## Title
Creating and deploying an end-to-end full-stack text summarizer NLP pipeline.

## Abstract
This project aims to develop a full-stack Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to summarize text data efficiently. The core of this system will be a machine learning model that takes extensive text inputs and outputs concise summaries. By integrating this model into a full-stack application, users will be able to access this functionality through a web interface. The project will cover all phases from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and user interface design, ensuring the tool is both effective and user-friendly.

## Research questions

1. Model Accuracy and Comparison:

How accurately can the NLP model replicate human-level text summarization based on various evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU)?
What are the differences in content coverage and coherence between machine-generated and human-generated summaries?

2. Scalability and Data Handling:

How does the summarization model's performance scale with increasing dataset sizes?
What are the computational requirements and infrastructure needed to handle and process large datasets effectively?

3. Algorithm Efficiency:

What algorithms provide the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for text summarization?
How can these algorithms be optimized for faster processing without compromising summary quality?

4. Real-time Processing and Technical Challenges:

Can the system generate summaries in real-time, and what are the primary computational and algorithmic challenges?
What techniques can be implemented to reduce latency in summary generation for real-time applications?


## Dataset
The SAMSum dataset is a prominent choice for this project. This dataset contains over 16,000 dialogue samples, each paired with a human-written summary, making it ideal for training and testing summarization models. The dataset is available in a JSON format, which facilitates easy integration and manipulation in data processing pipelines. We plan to:

Download: Access the dataset directly from publicly available sources or repositories.
Process: Use NLP techniques to clean and preprocess the text data (e.g., tokenization, removing stopwords).
Augment: Enrich the dataset by potentially adding custom tags or additional metadata to improve the model's context understanding.
Manage: Store the dataset in a structured format suitable for iterative access and updating during model training and evaluation.
The SAMSum dataset is well-documented, with various research papers and tutorials available, showcasing its application in similar tasks, which will help in effectively leveraging this resource.
