How have you been feeling recently?\nPatient: Well, lately I developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 \u03bcg\/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 \u03bcg\/day (MED 240 mg\/day). How has your pain been since then?\nPatient: It's been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but it's still quite painful.\nDoctor: I see. In addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 \u03bcg\/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea\/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 \u03bcg\/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?\nPatient: The patch has been helpful; I've noticed a difference.\nDoctor: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 \u03bcg\/day. We have been gradually decreasing the dose daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 \u03bcg\/day). As your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms.

We'll need to conduct some laboratory tests and an enhanced computed tomography scan to get a clearer picture of the issue.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n[After the tests]\nDoctor: Your lab results are all normal, and the enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 2.8 \u00d7 1.8 \u00d7 2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that doesn't appear to involve the mandible. We also found a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions.\nPatient: So, what does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. We will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it.\nPatient: Alright, so what will the surgery involve?\nDoctor: During the surgery, we'll make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, we'll find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland. We'll carefully free the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve from the tumor surface, and completely excise the tumor along with the sublingual gland.\nPatient: I see. What happens after the surgery?\nDoctor: After the surgery, we'll fix the tissue sample with 10% formalin and submit it for histopathological diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the tumor.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'm ready to proceed with the surgery and follow-up care.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll make sure to take good care of you during and after the surgery.

I've been having headaches lately.\nDoctor: I see. Are you experiencing any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms?\nPatient: No, just the headaches.\nDoctor: Alright. I understand that your previous in vitro fertilization pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia at 27 weeks of gestation, and you delivered a growth-restricted fetus by cesarean section at 36 weeks, weighing 1900 g. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: It seems that your regular medications include aspirin 100 mg and calcium 1.2 g daily. Additionally, your family history is significant for paternal ischemic heart disease and maternal hypertension. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, you've got it right.\nDoctor: During your pregnancy, laboratory investigations for preeclampsia revealed low-grade proteinuria with a urine protein\/creatinine ratio of 40 mg\/mmol, as well as normal renal and liver function. Your vasculitic screen showed a normal C-reactive protein level of 3.8 mg\/L, mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 16 mm\/h, and absence of antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antiphospholipid antibodies.

I've been having headaches lately.\nDoctor: I see. Are you experiencing any visual changes, chest pain, dyspnea, or other neurological symptoms?\nPatient: No, just the headaches.\nDoctor: Alright. I understand that your previous in vitro fertilization pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia at 27 weeks of gestation, and you delivered a growth-restricted fetus by cesarean section at 36 weeks, weighing 1900 g. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries.

You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\nDoctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue.

No significant past medical history was provided during the consultation.\nO: Examination findings include best corrected visual acuities of 20\/25 in the right eye and 20\/20 in the left eye, intraocular pressures of 14 mmHg in both eyes, and no afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full. Funduscopic examination revealed grade-four optic disc edema, blurring of the optic disc margin, and obscuration of vasculature with preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography confirmed optic nerve swelling. Fluorescein angiography showed hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in both eyes. Head CT, brain MRI, and MRV were unremarkable. CSF analysis showed an opening pressure of 30 cm H2O, 77 white blood cells\/mm3 with 94% lymphocytes, 93 mg\/dL protein, and 73 mg\/dL glucose. Bacterial and fungal cultures, as well as tests for Lyme, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, enterovirus, ANA, p-ANCA, and a respiratory viral panel, were all negative.\nA: The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic findings suggest a primary diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri.

However, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: During the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. There was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. We conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin (102 g\/L), prolonged prothrombin time (13.4 s), and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: These results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. Moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction.

Based on my assessment, I believe you have right submandibular salivary gland sialolithiasis. We'll need a computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm this diagnosis.\nPatient: Okay, so what happens if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis?\nDoctor: If the diagnosis is confirmed, we'll need to surgically remove the gland. The surgery will involve making a Risdon incision about 3 to 4 cm below your mandible. We'll identify and protect your marginal mandibular nerve and remove the submandibular gland from the mylohyoid muscle. Then, we'll divide and ligate the submandibular duct to remove the gland along with the calculi. In your case, we found a 7 mm spherical formation.\nPatient: Will there be any postoperative complications?\nDoctor: We'll place a suction drain and close the wound in layers to minimize the risk of complications. It's essential to attend your follow-up evaluations to monitor your recovery and ensure there are no postoperative complications. \nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything. I'll go ahead with the CT scan and surgery if necessary.\nDoctor: You're welcome. I'll make sure to provide you with all the information and support you need during the process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports experiencing pain and swelling in the right submandibular region for approximately 10 days. The symptoms are intermittent, worsening during meals and resolving post-meal. The patient also experiences discomfort when consuming sour or acidic foods.\nO: Clinical examination revealed visible swelling in the right submandibular region without any discharge. Bimanual palpation identified a firm swelling in the posterior floor of the mouth. A preliminary diagnosis of right submandibular salivary gland sialolithiasis was made, pending confirmation via computed tomography (CT) scan. The suspected calculi measured approximately 7 mm.\nA: The primary diagnosis is right submandibular salivary gland sialolithiasis, based on the clinical findings and patient's symptoms. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of salivary gland swelling such as infections or tumors, but these are less likely given the described symptoms and clinical findings.\nP: The management plan includes obtaining a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, surgical removal of the submandibular gland will be necessary. The procedure will involve a Risdon incision, with careful handling of the marginal mandibular nerve and division of the submandibular duct. Postoperative care will include placement of a suction drain and layered wound closure to minimize complications. The patient will be scheduled for follow-up evaluations to monitor recovery. Education regarding the procedure and postoperative care will be provided to ensure the patient's understanding and compliance."}]}

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, my voice has been really hoarse, and I've had trouble swallowing too.\nDoctor: I understand. I also noticed in your past medical history that you had invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which was ER positive, PR negative, and HER2 negative. You were treated with a mastectomy two years prior to this presentation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: During the clinical examination, we found paralysis of your right vocal cord. We also performed a CT scan of your neck, which revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. Have you experienced any other symptoms?\nPatient: No, not really. Just the hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.\nDoctor: Okay. We performed a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule, which was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance, falling under Bethesda category III. We did a repeat FNA three months later, and it yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule, which is Bethesda category II. \nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Due to your persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, as well as the atypical findings on the initial FNA, we decided to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy and a right vocal cord injection. Intraoperatively, we observed that your right thyroid lobe was moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: The right lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm in greatest dimension and weighed 16 grams. Upon further examination, we found multiple variably sized brown gelatinous nodules with focal areas of hemorrhage and cystic change in the thyroid parenchyma.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: The histologic examination revealed evidence of nodular thyroid hyperplasia. We also found multiple scattered subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma, which were present in 7 out of the 16 submitted tissue sections. Most of these smaller metastatic foci measured around 1 millimeter each and consisted of irregularly shaped nests of epithelioid tumor cells between thyroid follicles.\nPatient: Oh, no.\nDoctor: The largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma with cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact. These areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Additionally, we observed numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of C cell hyperplasia (CCH).\nPatient: What should I do now?\nDoctor: We'll need to discuss your treatment options and closely monitor your condition. We'll work together to determine the best course of action moving forward. It's important to stay vigilant and report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare team.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.

I see you've presented with hoarseness and dysphagia for the past three months following an upper respiratory infection. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, my voice has been really hoarse, and I've had trouble swallowing too.\nDoctor: I understand. I also noticed in your past medical history that you had invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which was ER positive, PR negative, and HER2 negative. You were treated with a mastectomy two years prior to this presentation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: During the clinical examination, we found paralysis of your right vocal cord. We also performed a CT scan of your neck, which revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. Have you experienced any other symptoms?\nPatient: No, not really. Just the hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.\nDoctor: Okay. We performed a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule, which was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance, falling under Bethesda category III. We did a repeat FNA three months later, and it yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule, which is Bethesda category II. \nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Due to your persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, as well as the atypical findings on the initial FNA, we decided to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy and a right vocal cord injection. Intraoperatively, we observed that your right thyroid lobe was moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.\nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: The right lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm in greatest dimension and weighed 16 grams. Upon further examination, we found multiple variably sized brown gelatinous nodules with focal areas of hemorrhage and cystic change in the thyroid parenchyma.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: The histologic examination revealed evidence of nodular thyroid hyperplasia. We also found multiple scattered subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma, which were present in 7 out of the 16 submitted tissue sections. Most of these smaller metastatic foci measured around 1 millimeter each and consisted of irregularly shaped nests of epithelioid tumor cells between thyroid follicles.\nPatient: Oh, no.\nDoctor: The largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma with cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact. These areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Additionally, we observed numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of C cell hyperplasia (CCH).\nPatient: What should I do now?\nDoctor: We'll need to discuss your treatment options and closely monitor your condition. We'll work together to determine the best course of action moving forward. It's important to stay vigilant and report any new or worsening symptoms to your healthcare team.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll make sure to keep in touch with my healthcare team."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports persistent hoarseness and dysphagia for three months following an upper respiratory infection.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hi there, I understand you originally had a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band 4 years ago. What brings you to the bariatric surgery clinic today?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Lately, I've had trouble tolerating solid foods.\nDoctor: I see. We did a work-up and found that your gastric band is still in good position, but you have oesophagitis and gastritis, causing swelling of the mucosa at the band site. We removed the fluid from the reservoir and treated you conservatively with anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. How have your symptoms been after 2 weeks of treatment?\nPatient: They've improved a lot, thanks!\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. After careful consideration, you decided to undergo revisional surgery to convert the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy. You went through the appropriate multidisciplinary team and were found to be a suitable candidate for surgery. The surgery went well, and there were no complications. You were discharged on post-operative day 3. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been okay, but on post-operative day 12, I started feeling lightheaded and short of breath, so I went to the hospital.\nDoctor: Yes, you were readmitted to an outside tertiary care hospital and found to have leukocytosis, with a high white blood cell count of 18,000 cells \u03bcl\u20131. A CT scan with intravenous contrast was performed, and you were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. You were immediately transferred to our center for definitive care.\nPatient: That's right, and when I arrived here, you all reviewed my CT films.\nDoctor: Yes, our radiologists noticed there was air and a faint suggestion of oral contrast outside of the suture line. Given this finding, we ordered an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) evaluation. During the early phase, no leak was observed, partly due to the slow passage of 30 ml oral non-ionic contrast.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Some residual contrast from the outside hospital CT was present in the transverse and descending colon. Only after delayed imaging and administration of additional non-ionic contrast were we able to determine the situation more accurately.\nPatient: So, what's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide appropriate treatment.

What brings you to the bariatric surgery clinic today?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. Lately, I've had trouble tolerating solid foods.\nDoctor: I see. We did a work-up and found that your gastric band is still in good position, but you have oesophagitis and gastritis, causing swelling of the mucosa at the band site. We removed the fluid from the reservoir and treated you conservatively with anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. How have your symptoms been after 2 weeks of treatment?\nPatient: They've improved a lot, thanks!\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that. After careful consideration, you decided to undergo revisional surgery to convert the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy. You went through the appropriate multidisciplinary team and were found to be a suitable candidate for surgery. The surgery went well, and there were no complications. You were discharged on post-operative day 3. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been okay, but on post-operative day 12, I started feeling lightheaded and short of breath, so I went to the hospital.\nDoctor: Yes, you were readmitted to an outside tertiary care hospital and found to have leukocytosis, with a high white blood cell count of 18,000 cells \u03bcl\u20131. A CT scan with intravenous contrast was performed, and you were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. You were immediately transferred to our center for definitive care.\nPatient: That's right, and when I arrived here, you all reviewed my CT films.\nDoctor: Yes, our radiologists noticed there was air and a faint suggestion of oral contrast outside of the suture line. Given this finding, we ordered an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) evaluation. During the early phase, no leak was observed, partly due to the slow passage of 30 ml oral non-ionic contrast.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Some residual contrast from the outside hospital CT was present in the transverse and descending colon. Only after delayed imaging and administration of additional non-ionic contrast were we able to determine the situation more accurately.\nPatient: So, what's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide appropriate treatment. Be sure to follow up with us regularly and report any new or worsening symptoms.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for keeping me informed and taking care of me."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient, who previously underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric band surgery 4 years ago, presented with difficulty tolerating solid foods.

What brings you to the emergency room today?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. For the past two days, I've been having abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and obstipation.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any other symptoms or changes, such as a distended abdomen?\nPatient: Yeah, now that you mention it, my abdomen does feel quite bloated and uncomfortable.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Let me do a deep palpation to check for any discomfort or peritoneal signs. *performs palpation* It seems there's some discomfort on deep palpation, but no peritoneal signs. We'll need to run some tests to further investigate the issue.\nPatient: Okay, Doctor.\nDoctor: *after running tests* Your white blood cell count is mildly elevated, and you have low potassium, which we've replaced. The computed tomography scan indicates that you might have a small bowel obstruction.\nPatient: Oh, no. What does that mean, and what should I do now?\nDoctor: We'll admit you to the hospital for further examination and treatment. We'll perform a small bowel follow-through to confirm the diagnosis.\n*the next day*\nDoctor: The small bowel follow-through revealed moderate distention of the stomach, multiple distended small bowel loops, and no evidence of contrast in the cecum at 14 hours. This is consistent with a small bowel obstruction. We'll need to take you to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy to address the issue.\nPatient: I understand. What could have caused this obstruction?\nDoctor: *after surgery* During the exploratory laparotomy, we performed a retrieval of a foreign body via an enterotomy. It appears that you ingested a pineapple core the day prior to your symptoms. The pineapple core was acting as a source of fiber, which may have contributed to the obstruction.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't realize that could cause a problem. I'm glad it's been taken care of.\nDoctor: Your surgery went well, and you're recovering nicely. We'll continue to monitor your progress, and if all goes well, you'll be discharged from the hospital soon.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance throughout this process."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: A 52-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a 2-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and obstipation.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've had trouble swallowing and I lost around 10 kg in the past 3 months. It's been really tough.\nDoctor: I see. I've noted that your height is 158.0 cm and your current weight is 53.6 kg. Upon admission, your body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 21.5. Besides this, you also have osteoporosis, which causes you to be bent over. You underwent distal gastrectomy due to a submucosal tumor 40 years ago, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I had the surgery a long time ago.\nDoctor: According to your operative note, the surgery was performed without lymph node dissection. After the retroperitoneal attachments behind the duodenum were dissected, a Billroth I reconstruction was performed. The resected mass was determined to be an aberrant pancreas. \nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We performed an upper gastrointestinal examination and found the presence of your postoperative stomach in the thoracic cavity via delayed barium passage. Endoscopic examination showed that esophagitis and tumor in the upper digestive tract were absent, which is good news.\nPatient: Oh, that's a relief.\nDoctor: However, enhanced computed tomography (eCT) revealed a large hiatal hernia involving the entire stomach, sliding through the hiatal orifice into the mediastinum. The stomach was expanded with food remaining inside, and it was compressing the heart in the posterior mediastinum. \nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: It is a concern, but fortunately, you have no symptoms of cardiac failure, and your heart function was normal on echocardiography. Preoperative eCT also showed that the right and left gastric arteries and the gastroepiploic arteries were preserved, which indicates that the distal gastrectomy was performed without lymph node dissection. \nPatient: So what's the next step, doc?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and the hiatal hernia diagnosis, your dysphagia is quite severe, so we recommend elective surgical repair of the hiatal hernia to alleviate your symptoms.\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\nDoctor: During the surgery, a total of five ports will be placed in your abdomen, and a Nathanson liver retractor will be inserted to retract the left liver lobe. A laparoscopic approach will be used to address the slight adhesion of the greater omentum just under the postoperative scar and the little adhesion with the liver and spleen.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, I see that you're a 72-year old female melanoma patient in disease stage IV (pT2a, N3c, M1d; AJCC 2017). Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Well, I have this bulky ulcerated tumor mass on my right upper leg, and I've been told that I have an asymptomatic singular brain metastasis, and some other suspected tumor lesions in my chest, iliac, inguinal, and lung areas.\nDoctor: I see. We've also found that your serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated at 566 U\/l, which is above the normal range of 135\u2013214 U\/l, and your S100B level is at 0.63 \u03bcg\/l, which is higher than the normal level of < 0.2 \u03bcg\/l. The BRAF, NRAS, and KIT mutation analysis showed gene wild-types. Based on the tumor board recommendation, we will initiate ipilimumab (3 mg\/kg body weight) and nivolumab (1 mg\/kg body weight) combination therapy. This treatment is approved by the FDA for patients with BRAF V600 wild-type, unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\nPatient: Oh, okay. What else is planned in terms of treatment?\nDoctor: We're also planning radiotherapy for the brain lesion (stereotactic) and the bulky mass on your right upper leg. Before starting the treatment, we found that you had normal blood leucocytes and a mild C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation.\nPatient: Hmm, got it.

Can you please tell me what brought you to the emergency department today?\nPatient: Hi, Doctor. I had a seizure at home, and my mom called an ambulance. It was my first time having a seizure.\nDoctor: I see. You arrived about 15 minutes after the seizure, correct?\nPatient: Yeah, that's right.\nDoctor: When you arrived, you were somnolent, arousable, and confused, which is consistent with a postictal state after a seizure. Can you tell me if you've been feeling unwell recently?\nPatient: Yeah, for the past two to three days, I've been feeling sick. I had upper respiratory infection symptoms, like cough and nasal congestion.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. Your mother mentioned that she heard a \"thud\" and found you on the floor shaking and incontinent of your bladder and bowels. She said the shaking lasted about one to two minutes. Can you confirm that?\nPatient: I don't remember it clearly, but that's what my mom told me.\nDoctor: Your mother also reported that you've had a decreased appetite recently and that you're usually a picky eater with a very limited diet. She said you've only eaten French fries since becoming sick. She's been encouraging you to drink Gatorade and Pedialyte for hydration. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's true.\nDoctor: Let's talk about your medical history. You have no significant past medical history, no surgeries or hospitalizations, and an allergy to amoxicillin that causes hives. You see a pediatrician regularly and are up to date on vaccines. You don't take any medications on a daily basis. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's all correct.\nDoctor: Your family history indicates hypertension, but no family history of seizure disorders. You live in a house, and your mother says you feel safe at home. No one else in the home has been ill recently. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: When you arrived, we took your vital signs. Your oral temperature was 38\u00b0 Celsius, heart rate 108 beats per minute, blood pressure 111\/70 millimeters of mercury, breathing rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygenating at 97% on room air. On the initial physical exam, you appeared drowsy but overall well developed. We will continue to monitor you and run some tests to determine the cause of the seizure. In the meantime, please let me know if you experience any changes in your condition.\nPatient: Okay, thank you, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. I will be back to check on you and discuss the test results. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.\nPatient: Thank you, I appreciate it."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient, a young individual with no significant past medical history, presented to the emergency department following a witnessed seizure at home, described by the patient's mother as involving shaking and incontinence, lasting one to two minutes.

Can you tell me about your medical history? Have you had any conditions or treatments in the past?\nPatient: Yes, I was treated for small cell cancer of the lung and had chemotherapy for it. Seven months ago, I had breathlessness and a pleural effusion was found during a routine examination. They also discovered a mycobacterial infection in the pleura.\nDoctor: It looks like you were treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and INH for the mycobacterial infection. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. But I had drug-induced hepatitis, so they changed my regimen to rifampicin and ethambutol with the addition of levofloxacin.\nDoctor: Alright, let's start by examining your eyes. First, we'll check your best-corrected visual acuity, which is 6\/15 in both eyes. Your extraocular movements and anterior segment examination seem normal. Now, I'll perform a dilated fundus examination. That looks normal as well.\nPatient: So, what could be causing my reduced vision?\nDoctor: Let's conduct a visual-evoked potential (VEP) test to get a better understanding of your condition. The VEP results show reduced amplitude and prolonged latency in both eyes, suggestive of bilateral optic axonopathy.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means there might be some damage to the optic nerves in both your eyes. To further investigate this, we'll need to do an MRI scan.\nPatient: Okay, what did the MRI scan show?\nDoctor: The MRI scan revealed multiple round peripherally enhancing lesions in both cerebral hemispheres and in the right cerebellum. Moreover, Central 30-2 perimetry revealed an incomplete left homonymous hemianopia with additional inferior temporal defects in the right eye.\nPatient: Is it related to the medications I've been taking?\nDoctor: Yes, based on these findings, it seems that ethambutol toxicity is the likely cause of your reduced vision, as the lesions in the cerebral hemispheres are not consistent with the perimetric findings.\nPatient: What should I do now? Are there any treatment options?\nDoctor: There are treatments available, but it's important to discuss them with your primary care physician and consider discontinuing ethambutol. However, I must let you know that the decision to proceed with any treatment is ultimately up to you.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll think about it and let you know if I decide to go ahead with the treatment.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.

The absence of pain, ulceration, and pathological lymph nodes is notable, but further imaging is required to refine the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.\nP: Plan to proceed with scheduling a maxillofacial CT scan and MRI to further evaluate the nature of the tonsillar mass and to assist in developing a comprehensive treatment strategy. Follow-up consultation will be arranged to discuss the results of the imaging studies and to determine the appropriate intervention based on those findings."}]}

Are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing, such as fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or any difficulty or pain while swallowing?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or odynophagia or dysphagia.\nDoctor: Thank you for letting me know. I see that you first presented to us back in September 2016, when you were diagnosed with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis (PJP) on transbronchial lung biopsy.

Let me conduct a neurological examination to better understand your condition. *After the examination* I found some weakness in your biceps and triceps muscles in your upper extremities and no movements in your intrinsic hand muscles, wrist extensors, or wrist flexors. In your lower extremities, there are trace movements of your hamstrings and no movements of your quadriceps, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, or intrinsic foot muscles.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds bad...\nDoctor: Your small fiber sensory modalities, like pin prick or light touch, are essentially normal, with only a mild decrease to pin prick on your right great toe. However, your large fiber sensory modalities are profoundly abnormal. You were unable to detect vibration with a Rydell tuning fork at your toes, ankles, knees, and fingers. Joint position was absent at your toes and left ankle, and reduced at both knees.\nPatient: I had no idea it was that extensive.\nDoctor: Your Compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes were unobtainable, except for a markedly reduced axillar nerve CMAP. Based on these findings, your CMT Neuropathy score is in the severe range of 28 out of 36.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: This means that your condition is quite severe, and it's important to continue using your mobility aids and seek appropriate treatment and therapy to maintain your quality of life. I will provide you with some recommendations and resources to help you manage your symptoms.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient, who has experienced mobility and balance issues since childhood, reports significant problems with fine motor skills and requires aids such as a pedestal walker and long leg braces for ambulation.

Differential diagnoses may include other forms of hereditary neuropathies or motor neuron diseases, but these are less likely given the clinical and electrophysiological findings.\nP: Continue use of mobility aids and initiate referral to a neurologist specialized in neuromuscular disorders for further evaluation and management. Physical therapy to maintain mobility and prevent complications is recommended. Occupational therapy consultation for assistance with activities of daily living, particularly those requiring fine motor skills. Regular follow-up to monitor progression of symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary.

Can you tell me more about the symptoms he's been experiencing?\nPatient's mother: Yes, he is our second child, and his development has been slower than usual. He began to walk and speak at 14 months of age, but he still doesn't know the alphabet, colors, or numbers.\nDoctor: I understand. It's important to note that your family's pedigree is remarkable as your maternal male first cousin also required special education for learning disabilities. Regarding your son's prenatal history, you had a chlamydia infection at 3 months gestational age, is that correct?\nPatient's mother: Yes, that's correct. I was treated with antibiotics for the infection.\nDoctor: Your son was born vaginally at 37 weeks gestational age, weighing 1.98 kg, and spent a total of 23 days in the NICU requiring nasogastric feeds and phototherapy. Is that accurate?\nPatient's mother: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: Your son was diagnosed with global developmental delay by a behavioral pediatrician and began early intervention services at 2 years of age, receiving occupational, physical, and speech therapy. Currently, he is in special education classes and is getting speech and occupational therapies. Can he understand directions and point to body parts?\nPatient's mother: Yes, he can do that.\nDoctor: In addition to these developmental delays, your son has a history of anemia, which is followed by his pediatrician. On physical exam, we found that he has a low anterior hairline, slightly downward slanting palpebral fissures, infraorbital puffiness, overfolded helices bilaterally, a broad nasal bridge, a wide grin, and a thin upper lip, which generally resembled your facial features.\nPatient's mother: Yes, I've noticed those similarities too.\nDoctor: We performed Clinical Fragile X testing on your son's DNA, and it came back normal with 29 CGG repeats. However, CMA testing using the SurePrint G3 ISCA CGH + SNP 4 \u00d7 180 microarray detected a heterozygous 1.21 Mb deletion of chromosome 3q29.\nPatient's mother: What does that mean for my son?\nDoctor: This genetic finding could be related to his developmental delays and other symptoms. We will need to continue monitoring his progress and providing the appropriate therapies to help him overcome these challenges.\nPatient's mother: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. What are the next steps for my son's care?\nDoctor: We will continue to work closely with his pediatrician and therapists to ensure he receives the appropriate support, and we will schedule regular follow-up appointments with our genetics team to monitor his progress.\nPatient's mother: I appreciate your help, doctor. We will do everything we can to support our son.\nDoctor: You're doing a great job, and we're here to help you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient's mother reports that her son, the second child, has experienced developmental delays, notably in walking and speaking, which began at 14 months.

I noticed a thickening of the iris, and it's been bothering me.\nDoctor: I see. Let's perform a gonioscopy to take a closer look at the root of the iris in your left eye. \n(After performing the gonioscopy)\nDoctor: The gonioscopy revealed a pigmented fusiform thickening of the iris root in your left eye. We also did an ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) which showed the presence of a well-circumscribed dome-shaped mass at the level of the ciliary body, between the 2:30 and 3 o'clock positions. The lesion is 8.18 mm large, 7.74 mm long, and 4.88 mm thick. It appears to be a melanoma of the ciliary body, involving the adjacent iris root.\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What's the next step?\nDoctor: In July 2008, you underwent brachytherapy using 106Ru. You received 100 Gy at the apex, with a dose rate of 79.09 cGy\/hr, and a total rate at the sclera of 531.1 Gy, with a dose rate of 420.1 cGy\/hr.\nPatient: Okay, I remember that treatment. Did it help?\nDoctor: One year later, you showed some scleral thinning and a prolapse of uveal tissue at the limbus, corresponding to the site of the preexisting lesion. UBM showed a local scleral extension of the tumor under the conjunctival layer, 0.88 mm thick. Your best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20\/20.\nPatient: So, what was the next step?\nDoctor: The patient underwent a radical block excision of the sclera, ciliary melanoma, and adjacent iris tissue. This was done by performing a peripheral iridectomy through the opening of the sclera, combined with a corneal tectonic graft, 8.50 mm large. We used 16 single stitches to close the wound.\nPatient: I remember that surgery. Did it remove the melanoma completely?\nDoctor: Histological analysis of the removed tissue confirmed the diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma. We will continue to monitor your condition and follow up with any necessary treatments or interventions.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and explanations."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports issues with the left eye, specifically a thickening of the iris that has been bothering them.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I've had this swelling on the right side of my cheek for about 6 months now. It's been getting bigger over time.\nDoctor: I see. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in the area?\nPatient: No, not really. There hasn't been any pain at all.\nDoctor: What about difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia? Have you noticed any issues with that?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trouble swallowing either.\nDoctor: Alright, let's take a look. *After examining the patient* I can see a single, cystic swelling in your right cheek, around 2x2 cm2 with ill-defined margins. It's nontender and palpable bimanually. The rest of your oropharynx and laryngopharynx appear normal, and there are no palpable neck nodes. Your vitals and blood parameters are also stable.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: To better understand this swelling, we performed a cytological examination of the mass. It was reported as a chronic granulomatous lesion. We also did a CT scan of your head and neck, which revealed a well-defined cystic lesion measuring 2.6x21x19 mm3 in the right buccal space, arising from the buccinator muscle and displacing the zygomaticus major.\nPatient: So what does all that mean?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we've made a provisional diagnosis of a right buccal cyst. We planned for an excision biopsy under general anesthesia and performed surgery with our team of ORL Head and Neck Surgeons.\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: Intraoperatively, we found a well-defined cystic lesion measuring around 3x3 cm2 in the right buccal space. The cyst contained thick mucinous fluid. We sent the specimen for histopathological examination, and the findings were consistent with an oncocytoma.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: After the surgery, we kept you on intravenous antibiotics. The postoperative period was uneventful, with mild soft tissue swelling over the operated area without any collections.

I've had this swelling on the right side of my cheek for about 6 months now. It's been getting bigger over time.\nDoctor: I see. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in the area?\nPatient: No, not really. There hasn't been any pain at all.\nDoctor: What about difficulty swallowing, or dysphagia? Have you noticed any issues with that?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trouble swallowing either.\nDoctor: Alright, let's take a look. *After examining the patient* I can see a single, cystic swelling in your right cheek, around 2x2 cm2 with ill-defined margins. It's nontender and palpable bimanually. The rest of your oropharynx and laryngopharynx appear normal, and there are no palpable neck nodes. Your vitals and blood parameters are also stable.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: To better understand this swelling, we performed a cytological examination of the mass. It was reported as a chronic granulomatous lesion. We also did a CT scan of your head and neck, which revealed a well-defined cystic lesion measuring 2.6x21x19 mm3 in the right buccal space, arising from the buccinator muscle and displacing the zygomaticus major.\nPatient: So what does all that mean?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, we've made a provisional diagnosis of a right buccal cyst. We planned for an excision biopsy under general anesthesia and performed surgery with our team of ORL Head and Neck Surgeons.\nPatient: How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: Intraoperatively, we found a well-defined cystic lesion measuring around 3x3 cm2 in the right buccal space. The cyst contained thick mucinous fluid. We sent the specimen for histopathological examination, and the findings were consistent with an oncocytoma.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: After the surgery, we kept you on intravenous antibiotics. The postoperative period was uneventful, with mild soft tissue swelling over the operated area without any collections. You were then discharged on the 7th postoperative day.\nPatient: That's good to hear. How has my recovery been going?\nDoctor: On your follow-up visit 1 week later, the swelling over the buccal region had subsided, and the intraoral surgical wound had healed.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hi there, can you please tell me what brings you here today?\nPatient: Well, I've had a history of intermittent, severe epigastric pain.\nDoctor: I see. How long have you been experiencing this pain?\nPatient: It's been happening for the past 5 months. The pain usually comes 15-30 minutes after every meal, but it's less severe and goes away on its own.\nDoctor: Okay, let's review your test results. Your full blood count, serum biochemistry values, and C-reactive protein level are within normal ranges. Your arterial gas analysis is also normal. However, your abdominal plain radiography showed free air between the liver and diaphragm, and PI (Fig.). Additionally, abdominal computed tomography showed severe calcification of the SMA origin; SMA peripheral flow was reserved (Fig.).

Did you experience any pain after consuming fluids?\nPatient: No, I didn't have any recurrent abdominal pain after drinking fluids.\nDoctor: Great. Since there was no pain, we allowed you to eat solid food as well. Now, we had planned an angiography to further investigate and potentially relieve your postprandial abdominal pain. The findings showed severe stenosis of the SMA origin with calcification, and the SMA had replaced the common hepatic artery (Fig., ). We performed ET, namely stenting to the SMA and common hepatic artery.\nPatient: How was the procedure done?\nDoctor: We engaged the SMA trunk with a 6F Parent Plus 60 guiding catheter (Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) from your left brachial artery. Initially, we infused 8000 units of heparin, and added additional heparin to keep your activated whole blood clotting time over 200 seconds.\nPatient: I see.

The prognosis is guarded due to the potential for infection and the need for ongoing monitoring of placental site and overall recovery.\nP: Management included cervical ripening with misoprostol, followed by operative delivery due to failed induction. Postoperatively, the patient was treated with antibiotics and methotrexate to manage placental implantation and prevent infection. She was discharged on day 8 post-operation with instructions for home recovery and follow-up care. Further consultations with obstetrics and possibly mental health services are recommended to address physical and emotional recovery. Compliance with medication and follow-up appointments is crucial for recovery and monitoring for potential complications."}]}
{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, I'm here because I fell from a bunk bed nine days ago and I hurt my left wrist. I got it checked at another facility and they put a splint on it, but I wanted a second opinion.\nDoctor: I see. Do you have a history of any other medical issues or injuries?\nPatient: Hmm, well, I've had some issues with intravenous drug abuse and I've been incarcerated before.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. Let's take a look at your wrist. I'll need to remove the splint and take new X-rays to assess the situation.\nPatient: Sure, go ahead.\n[Doctor takes X-rays]\nDoctor: Your X-rays show that the fracture is highly comminuted, meaning there are many small, intra-articular fragments. To restore overall radiographic parameters and stability, we'll use ligamentotaxis with a 2.4\/2.7 mm Synthes dorsal bridge plate. We'll also add percutaneously placed K wires for extra stabilization of the radial styloid and lunate facet.\nPatient: Okay, so what does that involve?\nDoctor: We'll make two incisions, one over the index metacarpal and one over the radial shaft. We won't open the third dorsal extensor compartment at the level of the wrist, which is a contrast to others' techniques. The plate will be placed deep to the extensor tendons in the proximal, radial shaft incision. We'll leave the K wire ends outside the skin to allow staged hardware removal without multiple trips to the operating room.\nPatient: Got it. And after the procedure, what will my recovery look like?\nDoctor: Postoperative X-rays will show improved radial inclination and articular congruity, with some residual slight dorsal tilt. You'll return for regular follow-up visits, and we'll remove the two K wires in the clinic about 4 weeks after surgery. At that point, you should be able to extend your thumb at the interphalangeal joint.\nPatient: That sounds good. Is there anything else I should know?\nDoctor: Plate removal will be discussed during your follow-up visits, but it's important to keep attending those appointments. In some cases, patients might experience sensations like clicking with wrist motion or difficulty extending their thumb.

What did you do to help me?\nDoctor: We immediately performed bloodwork upon your admission, which showed anemia with haemoglobin at 5.9 g\/dL, hematocrit at 17.4%, and erythrocyte count at 2.07 million\/uL. You also had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22,000\/uL, but your thrombocyte level was normal at 358,000\/uL.\nPatient: So what was the treatment?\nDoctor: We treated you with fluid resuscitation using both colloids and crystalloids, along with blood transfusion and uterotonics. We successfully performed a manual reposition of your uterus and applied internal bimanual compression for 15 minutes. However, you still had profuse hemorrhage due to uterine atony.\nPatient: How did you manage that?\nDoctor: We placed a balloon tamponade to stop the hemorrhage and reduce the risk of recurrence. Thankfully, your condition stabilized, and we didn't need to perform surgical management or a hysterectomy. We then repaired your perineal lacerations once the bleeding was under control.\nPatient: I'm glad to hear that. How am I doing now?\nDoctor: After transfusing 4 packed red cells, we repeated your bloodwork. Your hemoglobin is now at 10 g\/dL, hematocrit at 29%, erythrocyte count at 3.66 million\/uL, leucocyte count at 20,900\/uL, and thrombocyte count at 159,000\/uL. You have shown significant improvement.\nPatient: That's a relief. What's next for me?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely. It is important to have follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to ensure your complete recovery."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: 24-year-old primigravid female presented to the emergency department after childbirth, reporting heavy vaginal bleeding and loss of consciousness following placental delivery with placental traction.

Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?\nPatient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.\nDoctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?\nPatient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\nPatient: What can be done about it?\nDoctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\nPatient: What should I expect during the surgery?\nDoctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia.

Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this pain?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. It's been pretty bad.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain, how would you rate your pain?\nPatient: I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10.\nDoctor: Have you found anything that helps relieve the pain?\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and they seem to help.\nDoctor: Good to know. Do you have any muscle contracture or pain when I press on the area?\nPatient: No, I don't have any contracture, and it doesn't hurt when you press on it.\nDoctor: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?\nPatient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\nPatient: What can be done about it?\nDoctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\nPatient: What should I expect during the surgery?\nDoctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio\u00ae to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D\/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I feel more comfortable knowing what to expect.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to make the procedure as smooth and successful as possible. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports experiencing painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy for approximately 18 months, rating the pain as 7-8 out of 10.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, I see that you've been referred to our hospital due to a mass that was incidentally discovered in your right kidney. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: The mass is 16-mm in size and located in the anterior medial position of your kidney. We performed a renal biopsy, which confirmed that it's renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer.\nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible.\nDoctor: I understand your concern. We have a treatment plan to address this issue. We placed a hook wire in the tumor with the help of an interventional radiologist and CT guidance.\nPatient: What's the purpose of that?\nDoctor: The hook wire helps us localize the tumor during surgery. It's a technique we use for nonpalpable breast lesions to facilitate intraoperative localization. We will perform a partial nephrectomy to remove the tumor.\nPatient: How does the surgery work?\nDoctor: You will be placed in a modified left lateral decubitus position, and we will establish pneumoperitoneum.

We will mobilize your bowel medially and develop the plane between the anterior Gerota's fascia and the posterior mesocolon.\nPatient: Okay, and then?\nDoctor: Your kidney will be mobilized within Gerota's fascia. We will locate the hook wire and clamp the renal artery with a bulldog. The renal capsule will be resected using scissors under warm ischemia, which will take about 25 minutes.\nPatient: How will you stop the bleeding?\nDoctor: Hemostasis will be achieved using a combination of cautery, hemostatic agents, and suturing.

I don't have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.\nDoctor: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ng\/ml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilson's disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.\nPatient: Yeah, that's right. I also remember that my \u03b1-1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mg\/dl.\nDoctor: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index (BMI) of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, you've been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.\nPatient: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?\nDoctor: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93%. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.\nPatient: That's good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.\nDoctor: Yes, on postoperative day two, you became dyspneic while walking to the restroom. We also noted a two-gram drop in your hemoglobin level after surgery, which was promptly corrected with two units of packed red blood cells.\nPatient: Oh, I see. Did that help with my shortness of breath?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, despite the administration of packed red blood cell transfusions, you still experienced hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82% while sitting up and during ambulation.

Do you have any documented history of allergies or complications with anesthesia?\nPatient: No, I don't.\nDoctor: On the day of your operation, we administered cephalexin 2 mg. When we opened your left knee, we found cloudy fluid, which was sent for culture and sensitivities. We debrided and irrigated the infected cement spacers on your femur and tibia. A tobramycin and vancomycin cement mixture formed the new spacer. Intraoperatively, you had brief episodes of hypotension on induction, requiring 3 pressors.\nPatient: Oh, I didn't know that.\nDoctor: For the duration of the case, you required intermittent pressure support with a total of phenylephrine 360 mcg, epinephrine 30 mcg, and norepinephrine 36 mcg. After the surgery, you were extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: Your medications postoperatively included celecoxib 200 mg BID and aspirin 325 mg BID, and we continued you on lansoprazole. We also started you on vancomycin 2 g IV every 12 hours and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours.\nPatient: Okay, got it.\nDoctor: The cultures revealed that your joint was infected with Corynebacterium striatum, so we discontinued the IV piperacillin-tazobactam.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: On postoperative day 2, you developed a nonoliguric AKI, and your creatinine levels increased from a baseline of 0.9 mg\/dl to 1.5 mg\/dl.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your kidney function and adjust your medications accordingly.

Have you had any surgeries in the past, specifically in the abdominal area?\nPatient: I had a caesarean section six years ago, but that's it.\nDoctor: Alright. I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of the mass. \nPatient: Sure, go ahead.\nDoctor: *Examines the patient* I can feel a circumscribed mass measuring approximately 6 cms in diameter in the infraumbilical region to the left of the midline. The mobility of the swelling seems to be restricted when you contract your muscles, which may suggest infiltration of the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: It means the mass may be affecting the muscles and tissues beneath the skin. We will need to conduct some laboratory investigations and a CT scan to get a clearer picture. \nPatient: Okay, let's do it.\n*After the tests*\nDoctor: The laboratory results are within normal limits, and the CT scan revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcutaneous tissues, infiltrating the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures. This is highly suggestive of an abdominal wall endometrioma.\nPatient: So, what's the next step for me?\nDoctor: The best course of action would be surgical resection. We would remove the endometrioma along with a portion of the underlying aponeurosis and rectus abdominis muscle.\nPatient: And after that?\nDoctor: We will place a polypropylene mesh over the defect created by the resection and fix it to the anterior rectus sheath with nonabsorbable sutures. This will help to reinforce the area and promote healing.\nPatient: What can I expect after the surgery?\nDoctor: The postoperative course should be uneventful. We will perform a histopathological evaluation of the resected specimen to ensure clear resection margins. Following the procedure, there should be no seroma at the operative site, and you should experience complete relief of symptoms.\nPatient: That sounds great.

It's been gradually increasing in size and causing me discomfort.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in the mass or your symptoms during certain times, such as during your menstrual cycle?\nPatient: Yes, it gets worse during my menses. The mass seems to get bigger and the pain becomes more intense.\nDoctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Have you had any surgeries in the past, specifically in the abdominal area?\nPatient: I had a caesarean section six years ago, but that's it.\nDoctor: Alright. I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of the mass. \nPatient: Sure, go ahead.\nDoctor: *Examines the patient* I can feel a circumscribed mass measuring approximately 6 cms in diameter in the infraumbilical region to the left of the midline. The mobility of the swelling seems to be restricted when you contract your muscles, which may suggest infiltration of the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: It means the mass may be affecting the muscles and tissues beneath the skin. We will need to conduct some laboratory investigations and a CT scan to get a clearer picture. \nPatient: Okay, let's do it.\n*After the tests*\nDoctor: The laboratory results are within normal limits, and the CT scan revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcutaneous tissues, infiltrating the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures. This is highly suggestive of an abdominal wall endometrioma.\nPatient: So, what's the next step for me?\nDoctor: The best course of action would be surgical resection. We would remove the endometrioma along with a portion of the underlying aponeurosis and rectus abdominis muscle.\nPatient: And after that?\nDoctor: We will place a polypropylene mesh over the defect created by the resection and fix it to the anterior rectus sheath with nonabsorbable sutures. This will help to reinforce the area and promote healing.\nPatient: What can I expect after the surgery?\nDoctor: The postoperative course should be uneventful. We will perform a histopathological evaluation of the resected specimen to ensure clear resection margins. Following the procedure, there should be no seroma at the operative site, and you should experience complete relief of symptoms.\nPatient: That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Your ECG revealed sinus rhythm and ST-T wave changes, and myocardial ischemia was suspected. Echocardiography showed that your ejection fraction was 77%, the right ventricle end-diastolic diameter was 23 mm, tricuspid valve regurgitation, and a valve area of approximately 2.0 cm2. Abdominal ultrasound showed no abnormalities of the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, or kidney. Based on these findings, we suspected double pneumonia and prescribed another course of antibiotics. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: After two days of antibiotics, my left chest pain was alleviated, but then a similar but more severe pain appeared.\nDoctor: I see. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment as necessary. Please make sure to follow up with us regularly and let us know if there are any changes in your symptoms or if you have any concerns.

Due to your progressive respiratory distress, intubation was required. \nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We also conducted a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 560\/\u03bcl, with 99% granulocytes, proteins at 1264 mg\/dl, glucose at 3 mg\/dl, and lactate at 27 mmol\/l.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: The CSF and blood cultures tested positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is sensitive to penicillin G and ceftriaxone. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.016 mcg\/ml for penicillin G and ceftriaxone in the CSF, and 0.012 and 0.008 mcg\/ml in blood for penicillin G and ceftriaxone, respectively.\nPatient: So, what's the treatment plan?\nDoctor: We've started you on a combination of dexamethasone (10 mg q6h for 4 days) and ceftriaxone (2 g q12h for 14 days). After 10 days, we'll repeat the CSF analysis to confirm the drop in WBC count and eradication of the causative microorganism.\nPatient: Alright, thank you.\nDoctor: However, I have to inform you that you've been referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to the worsening of your GCS score, which is now 6\/15. Even though there's no evidence of acute hydrocephalus, we'll be monitoring your intracranial pressure (ICP).\nPatient: I understand, doctor. Thank you for letting me know.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you recover. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient, admitted to the Emergency Department, reports symptoms of agitation and altered consciousness starting a few hours ago, with a progressive loss of verbal contact.

We also took X-rays of your right arm to rule out any trauma, but the results were negative. \nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: Additionally, we found that you have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6 g\/dL, and thrombocytosis, with a platelet count of 512,000. \nPatient: Oh, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that your red blood cells are smaller than normal, and you have an increased number of platelets in your blood. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head without contrast, which showed hypodensity of the left thalamus and high attenuation throughout the bilateral deep venous system, compatible with acute DCVT.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: It is a concerning finding, but we've already initiated anticoagulation therapy and IV hydration to address the issue.

The MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in the central aspect of the thalamus, surrounded by vasogenic edema, indicating an acute venous infarction. Thankfully, no other parenchymal lesions were detected. \nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We also conducted an MR venography, which confirmed a lack of flow-related signal throughout the deep venous system.

Can you tell me more about your recent health?\nPatient: Yeah, I had a viral illness about 5 days ago. I felt really tired, had a fever, and even vomited and had diarrhea.\nDoctor: I see. Were you seen by a pediatrician during that time?\nPatient: Yes, they said I had mild dehydration and suggested oral rehydration and antipyretics for my fever.\nDoctor: That's a good course of action. And are your immunizations up-to-date?\nPatient: Yes, they are.\nDoctor: Great. Upon arrival, we did a physical exam and noticed flaccidity in your right upper and lower extremities. We also took X-rays of your right arm to rule out any trauma, but the results were negative. \nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: Additionally, we found that you have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6 g\/dL, and thrombocytosis, with a platelet count of 512,000. \nPatient: Oh, what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that your red blood cells are smaller than normal, and you have an increased number of platelets in your blood. We also performed a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head without contrast, which showed hypodensity of the left thalamus and high attenuation throughout the bilateral deep venous system, compatible with acute DCVT.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: It is a concerning finding, but we've already initiated anticoagulation therapy and IV hydration to address the issue. After discussing the radiologic findings with the ED physician, we decided to transfer you to the Intensive Care Unit of our tertiary pediatric hospital.\nPatient: What will happen there?\nDoctor: We'll perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your brain, which will help us assess the extent of the issue. The MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in the central aspect of the thalamus, surrounded by vasogenic edema, indicating an acute venous infarction. Thankfully, no other parenchymal lesions were detected. \nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We also conducted an MR venography, which confirmed a lack of flow-related signal throughout the deep venous system. You'll have a follow-up MR venography done two days later before discharge. At that time, there was no significant interval change, but we did find a relatively stable venous infarct in the left thalamus and posterior limb of the internal capsule.\nPatient: Will I recover from this?\nDoctor: Your symptoms resolved completely after six months of physical and speech therapy, with no residual symptoms. You'll be closely followed by pediatric neurology to ensure your continued recovery.\nPatient: I'm glad to hear that.

Immunofluorescence indicated weak deposition of IgM, fibrinogen, and C1q in mesangio-capillary regions. An electron micrograph showed diffuse endothelial swelling with obliteration of capillary lumina. The pathology was diagnosed as renal-limited TMA. Other causes of nephrotic syndrome, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, were ruled out.\nPatient: So, was it the ramucirumab that caused all this?\nDoctor: Yes, it appears that ramucirumab is the likely cause of your TMA. Since the biopsy, the ramucirumab treatment has been discontinued.\nPatient: What should I expect now?\nDoctor: By 6 weeks (day 69) after your last ramucirumab injection, your thrombocytopenia should be resolved, and your platelet count should return to normal levels.

It is crucial to report any new or worsening symptoms promptly. Continued surveillance with imaging studies such as PET-CT scans may be necessary to assess disease progression or response to therapy. Referral to a specialist in rare diseases or a multidisciplinary team experienced in managing ECD should be considered to optimize care and outcomes."}]}

Can you tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, I suffered some blunt chest and abdominal trauma, and I also had a concussion, but I didn't lose consciousness.\nDoctor: I see. It's good to know that you were conscious. Your Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15, which means you were alert and responsive. You were also hemodynamically stable when you arrived at the hospital.\nPatient: That's a relief to hear. How did my abdomen feel when I got here?\nDoctor: Your abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender to palpation with no guarding. That's a good sign. We also conducted some lab tests to check your blood levels.\nPatient: What were the results of the lab tests?\nDoctor: Your labs were significant for a hemoglobin count of 14.2 g\/dL, which is within the normal range of 13.5\u201317.5 g\/dL. Your white blood count was 11.8 1000\/\u03bcL, slightly higher than the normal range of 4.5\u201311 1000\/\u03bcL, and your lactate level was 1.7 mmol\/L, which is also within the normal range of 0.7\u20132.1 mmol\/L. These levels remained stable throughout your hospital course.\nPatient: Okay, so what happened next?\nDoctor: We performed an initial intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis 10 minutes after you arrived. The CT scan was interpreted by a radiology resident 15 minutes later, and a board-certified emergency radiologist completed the final interpretation in an additional 1 hour and 25 minutes.\nPatient: What did the CT scan show?\nDoctor: The initial CT interpretation indicated nonspecific wall thickening of the proximal jejunum, and occult small bowel injury could not be excluded. Given these findings, we ordered a repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast as per our institution's standard protocol for evaluation of possible occult bowel injury in blunt abdominal trauma.\nPatient: When was the follow-up CT performed?\nDoctor: The follow-up CT was performed after midnight, 8 hours after the initial CT. It demonstrated trace pneumoperitoneum, possibly originating from the splenic flexure of the colon without evidence of extravasation of oral contrast.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: Pneumoperitoneum refers to the presence of air or gas in your abdominal cavity. It can be a sign of an injury in your abdomen. The time from repeat CT scan completion to initial interpretation by a radiology resident was 30 minutes. They made the surgery team aware of these findings immediately.\nPatient: Did the emergency radiologist confirm the presence of pneumoperitoneum?\nDoctor: Yes, a board-certified emergency radiologist reviewed the study 10 minutes later and provided another preliminary interpretation, confirming the presence of pneumoperitoneum.\nPatient: So, what's the next step, doctor?\nDoctor: The surgery team will assess your condition based on the presence of pneumoperitoneum in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma.

Her right eye appears to be normal.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: Based on the findings, the presumptive diagnosis is that your dog has unilateral dacryocystitis, which is an inflammation of the tear sac, likely due to a foreign body in her left eye.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What can we do to help her?\nDoctor: We will need to remove the foreign body and provide appropriate treatment to resolve the inflammation and infection.

The onset was sudden, occurring after a walk in a meadow. No prior changes in the eye were noted before the discharge began. The dog has been treated with 0.3% tobramycin eye drops without observed improvement.\nO: Ophthalmic examination revealed abundant mucopurulent to haemorrhagic discharge and moderate conjunctival hyperemia in the left eye. No other abnormalities were noted in the affected eye, and the right eye appears normal.\nA: The primary diagnosis is unilateral dacryocystitis, likely secondary to a foreign body in the left eye. The lack of response to tobramycin suggests either an inappropriate treatment for the underlying cause or a resistant infection.\nP: The management plan includes removal of the foreign body from the left eye under sedation or anesthesia. Post-removal, appropriate antibiotic therapy will be adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the resolution of the infection and inflammation.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello Mr. Turner, I've been reviewing your case and I wanted to talk to you about your condition. You are a 65-year-old ambulatory diabetic patient with concomitant mental illness and alcoholism. It seems that you've had some difficulty sticking to your diabetic regime in the past. Can you share more about that?\nPatient: Yeah, I had a tough time managing my diabetes. I guess I just didn't take it seriously enough.\nDoctor: I understand, Mr. Turner. Over a 21-month period, you had 44 emergency department visits and 27 hospitalizations, with over half of those hospitalizations being in the Intensive Care Unit for diabetic ketoacidosis. It became medically necessary to involve Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) to help you manage your condition better. How have you been feeling since the HBPC visits started?\nPatient: Oh, those visits have made a huge difference! I feel much more engaged in my care now, and I'm starting to understand how important it is to manage my diabetes.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. I see that the HBPC team consulted behavioral health clinicians to help you with your mental health and alcoholism as well. Are you finding their support helpful?\nPatient: Yes, they've been really helpful. I feel like I'm finally getting the support I need to deal with everything going on in my life.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Turner. I also noticed that you got new glasses to help you read your insulin syringes. Has that made a difference in your ability to manage your diabetes?\nPatient: Absolutely! I can finally see the markings on the syringes clearly, so I'm more confident in taking the right amount of insulin.\nDoctor: That's excellent, Mr. Turner. It seems like after the house calls were initiated, your adherence to your diabetic regime and your overall quality of life dramatically improved. In fact, you've only had one hospitalization over the next two years. How do you feel about your progress?\nPatient: I'm really happy with how things are going. It's been a big change, but I feel like I'm finally in control of my health.\nDoctor: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Turner. HBPC programs like the one you're participating in are increasing in prevalence across the United States, thanks to health systems promoting value-based care. These programs aim to provide high-quality, compassionate care in the home for patients with the highest level of medical need, while also achieving cost savings.\nPatient: That's good to know. It's definitely been a lifesaver for me.\nDoctor: Yes, these programs can be quite beneficial. They come in different models, including hospital-based, government-run, and free-standing programs. They often involve an interdisciplinary team approach, and some even have a financial entity that takes on the risk for patient care, which can lead to shared cost-savings as a result of better care.\nPatient: Wow, I didn't realize there were so many different types of programs. I'm just grateful I got the help I needed.\nDoctor: We're glad to help, Mr. Turner. Just remember to continue following your diabetic regime and the advice of your healthcare team. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

They gave me a bunch of medications.\nDoctor: Yes, during Induction Phase I, you received PEG-ASP (1000 IU\/m2) on days 4 and 18, daunorubicin 30 mg\/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg\/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, dexamethasone 10 mg\/m2 on days 1\u20134, 8\u201311, 15\u201318, and intrathecal methotrexate (ITMTX) 12.5 mg on day 14. You were also given continuous imatinib 400 mg, which was later escalated to 600 mg daily throughout your induction treatment.\nPatient: That's right. And then I had another round of treatment.\nDoctor: Correct. During Phase II induction, you were given cyclophosphamide 1000 mg\/m2 on days 1 and 15, Ara-C 75 mg\/m2 on days 2\u20135, 9\u201312, 16\u201319, and 23\u201326, mercaptopurine 60 mg\/m2 throughout, and intrathecal methotrexate on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\nPatient: So, what happened after that?\nDoctor: After Phase II induction, you achieved a complete molecular remission with negative BCR-ABL1 p190 transcripts, as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, you did experience some complications, including constipation, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia.\nPatient: Yeah, that was a tough time. What came next?\nDoctor: To consolidate your remission, you underwent myeloablative conditioning, which included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI). This was followed by a stem cell transplant to help rebuild your immune system and fight off any remaining cancer cells.\nPatient: I remember that. It was quite an intense treatment.\nDoctor: Yes, it can be. But the good news is that you achieved a complete molecular remission, which is a great outcome.

I see from your history that you've been dealing with Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL for two years now. Can you tell me about the symptoms that led you to the emergency department back in June 2015?\nPatient: Yeah, I had been feeling really tired and lethargic for a couple of weeks. I also had backache, leg, and rib pain that was so bad that even opioids didn't help.\nDoctor: I see. Your blood counts at that time showed leukocytosis with a white cell count of 67 \u00d7 10^9 cells\/l and 34% lymphoblasts measured by flow cytometry. Your hemoglobin was 12.3 g\/dl and your platelet count was at 49 \u00d7 10^9\/l. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy confirmed that you had a precursor B-cell ALL, Ph+ (t 9; 22). You were then enrolled in the UKALL14, version 6 Protocol, which is a five-drug induction regimen designed for adults with de novo ALL between 25 and 65 years. \nPatient: Yeah, I remember that. They gave me a bunch of medications.\nDoctor: Yes, during Induction Phase I, you received PEG-ASP (1000 IU\/m2) on days 4 and 18, daunorubicin 30 mg\/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg\/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, dexamethasone 10 mg\/m2 on days 1\u20134, 8\u201311, 15\u201318, and intrathecal methotrexate (ITMTX) 12.5 mg on day 14. You were also given continuous imatinib 400 mg, which was later escalated to 600 mg daily throughout your induction treatment.\nPatient: That's right. And then I had another round of treatment.\nDoctor: Correct. During Phase II induction, you were given cyclophosphamide 1000 mg\/m2 on days 1 and 15, Ara-C 75 mg\/m2 on days 2\u20135, 9\u201312, 16\u201319, and 23\u201326, mercaptopurine 60 mg\/m2 throughout, and intrathecal methotrexate on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\nPatient: So, what happened after that?\nDoctor: After Phase II induction, you achieved a complete molecular remission with negative BCR-ABL1 p190 transcripts, as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, you did experience some complications, including constipation, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia.\nPatient: Yeah, that was a tough time. What came next?\nDoctor: To consolidate your remission, you underwent myeloablative conditioning, which included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI). This was followed by a stem cell transplant to help rebuild your immune system and fight off any remaining cancer cells.\nPatient: I remember that. It was quite an intense treatment.\nDoctor: Yes, it can be. But the good news is that you achieved a complete molecular remission, which is a great outcome.

Echocardiography showed severely depressed left ventricular function with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20%, global hypokinesia, and mild regurgitations without pulmonary artery hypertension. ECG indicated sinus tachycardia at 150 bpm, poor R wave progression, and nonspecific ST-T changes. Lab results showed Troponin I at 1.69 ng\/mL, CPK-MB at 5.2 ng\/mL, and BNP at 2000 pg\/mL. The patient developed cardiogenic shock, indicated by worsening hypotension and metabolic acidosis despite high-dose vasopressors and inotropes.\nA: The primary diagnosis is cardiogenic shock secondary to septic myocarditis, post-surgical complications from adenocarcinoma treatment. Differential diagnosis included acute coronary syndrome, but septic myocarditis is more likely given the clinical context and findings.\nP: The management plan includes daily aspirin 75 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, injection fondaparinux 2.5 mg, and injection torsemide 20 mg thrice daily.

Can you tell me about your past medical history?\nPatient: Yes, two years ago, I had a left salpingo-oopherectomy for an ovarian mucinous adenocarcinoma. I received six cycles of combined chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel afterward and was advised to use contraception. I didn't follow up after that, and now I am pregnant.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing that information.

We should also do an ultrasound examination to investigate further.\nPatient: Okay, what did you find in the ultrasound?\nDoctor: The ultrasound shows an intra-uterine pregnancy of 23 weeks and a right ovarian mass of 12.8 x 8.8 cm with solid and cystic areas containing free fluid with internal echoes. Your CA-125 level is also elevated at 80 IU\/ml. Based on these findings, it seems like you have recurrent ovarian cancer during your pregnancy.\nPatient: Oh no, what are my options?\nDoctor: Ideally, we would recommend surgical management to address the cancer. However, I understand that you declined this option. Instead, we started you on two courses of chemotherapy with a single dose of carboplatin 450mg intravenously at three-week intervals.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. But I couldn't do the third course because my liver function tests were not good.\nDoctor: That's correct. Unfortunately, the ascites has been progressive, which has led to maternal respiratory distress and fetal growth restriction and oligohydroamnios. We have decided to plan an elective Cesarean section with staging laparotomy at 34 weeks for the breech presentation with decreased liquor and gross ascites, after completion of steroid cover.\nPatient: What will happen during the surgery?\nDoctor: Intraoperatively, we will drain the hemorrhagic ascetic fluid, which could be around 20 liters.

Can you tell me more about how it started and how it has progressed?\nPatient: Yes, it started as a small 2 cm bruise-like patch on my forehead about four months before I came to the hospital. Then it rapidly developed into a large purplish plaque after one month and eventually to the current presentation.\nDoctor: I see. Ill-defined, dusky erythematous plaques were also observed extending on the parietal and frontal areas of your scalp and face, along with violaceous-darkish nodules. Are you aware of any comorbidities that you have, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, or ischemic encephalopathy?\nPatient: Yes, I have all of those conditions.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. During your physical examination, we also found bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Your relatives provided us with photographic documentation of the evolution of your lesion. I understand that the second lockdown in Italy and the fear of SARS-CoV-2 contagion led them to postpone your medical evaluation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: We performed a biopsy from a violaceous nodule on your lesion, which showed a full dermal proliferation of irregular anastomosing vascular channels lined by single or double layers of enlarged endothelial cells. These cells permeated between collagen bundles, causing \"collagen dissection.\" The endothelial cells were large and pleomorphic, with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. They were immunoreactive for CD31, CD34, and ERG, with no observed HHV8 expression or MYC overexpression.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Based on these data, we have confirmed the diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the scalp. We also conducted a total body computed tomography (CT) scan that showed cervical lymphadenopathy without brain or visceral metastases. \nPatient: So, what's the next step, doctor?\nDoctor: While radiotherapy and electrochemotherapy were considered for your treatment, we decided not to perform these due to your advanced age, comorbidities, and the large size of the tumor. Instead, we referred you to palliative care for symptom management and to improve your quality of life.\nPatient: I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient, who presented with a large ulcerated and necrotic lesion on the forehead, initially noticed a small bruise-like patch approximately four months prior to hospital presentation.

Can you describe the symptoms you've been experiencing?\nPatient: Yeah, my right leg has been really swollen and painful. It's been difficult to walk around.\nDoctor: I understand. So, before your surgical thrombectomy, you received a suprarenal IVC filter due to the short distance between the thrombus in the distal IVC and the inflow of renal veins. The surgical access was established via venotomy of the common femoral vein, and an occlusion balloon was used for the thrombectomy. How did you feel after the procedure?\nPatient: I felt a bit better, but still had some pain and swelling in my leg.\nDoctor: Hmm, I see. In a follow-up CT, we found that the filter had dislodged and tilted towards the right IVC wall with its legs piercing the contralateral wall and extending into the left renal vein. This was likely due to the surgical thrombectomy. You were given oral anticoagulation with Warfarin, but unfortunately, there was a re-thrombosis. We then performed catheter-directed thrombolysis, including stenting of the common iliac veins and the IVC. However, we didn't attempt filter retrieval at that time due to the large amount of clot within the filter.\nPatient: Oh, I see. So, what happened next?\nDoctor: After 5 weeks of Warfarin therapy, you were scheduled for a retrieval, which was considered mandatory due to the displaced and tilted filter with penetrating legs.

Interestingly, a chest CT performed five years ago showed an expanded bronchus in the small right lower lobe, suggesting pulmonary hypoplasia of the right inferior lobe (Fig. C). Let's move forward with a dynamic CT angiography to check for any blood leakage.\n[After reviewing the dynamic CT angiography]\nDoctor: We couldn't detect any extravasation of blood on the arterial and venous phase in the angiography. However, a bronchoscopic examination revealed that your right inferior lobar bronchus was filled with blood clots (Fig. D).\nPatient: Oh no, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is concerning. We performed a bronchial artery angiography, which confirmed the expansion and meandering of the bronchial arteries and the growth of the reticular artery from the diaphragm arteries (Fig. E). We attempted two arterial embolizations and also plugged an endobronchial Watanabe spigot into your right inferior lobar bronchus, but unfortunately, they failed to stop the haemoptysis.\nPatient: What's the next step then?\nDoctor: We had to perform a thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy to remove the affected area. The excised surgical specimen presented a small hypoaerated, atrophied, and occluded right inferior lobe. The bronchus was underdeveloped and irregular throughout its running (Fig. F).\nPatient: I see. What should I do now, Doctor?\nDoctor: It's important to monitor your condition closely and follow up with us regularly. We'll keep an eye on any changes and manage your symptoms as needed. We're here to support you through this process.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor.

Differential diagnoses previously considered included undiagnosed bleeding disorders or malignancy, which have been ruled out by investigations and surgical findings.\nP: The patient will require close monitoring and regular follow-up to manage any postoperative complications and to monitor for recurrence of symptoms. It is important to manage his chronic conditions, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and ensure that his pacemaker function is regularly checked. Patient education regarding signs of infection, proper wound care, and when to seek immediate medical attention is crucial.

Past imaging and biopsies have shown various sites of hypermetabolic activity and metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with his known breast cancer. Vital signs and further specifics on current physical examination findings are not provided in the transcript.\nA: Primary diagnosis is acute appendicitis, with a significant background of metastatic breast cancer. Differential diagnosis for his systemic symptoms may include complications or progression of his known cancer; however, the immediate concern is the appendicitis.\nP: Admit to general surgery for appendectomy. Post-surgery, ensure follow-up with oncology to reassess and potentially adjust his cancer treatment plan. Continue surveillance as previously outlined by his oncology team. Educate the patient on signs of complications related to both appendicitis and his ongoing cancer management. Ensure compliance with post-operative care and oncology follow-up."}]}
{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, I see you've come to our services for exertional dyspnoea. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having trouble breathing when I exert myself.\nDoctor: I understand. I see from your medical history that you had aortic valve stenosis and received an orthotopic heart transplantation in 1994 for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, we don't have the data from your transplant procedure as it was done 23 years ago. Have you experienced any issues since then?\nPatient: No, not really. I've been mostly asymptomatic except for paroxysmal atrial flutter. I got a single chamber pacemaker in 2008 and then had an atrial flutter ablation in 2010.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Have you been adhering to your medication regimen?\nPatient: Yep, I've been taking my meds as prescribed.\nDoctor: Great. It seems that you haven't shown any signs of transplant rejection on several cardiac biopsies. However, you do have some post-transplant cardiovascular risk factors like systemic hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and stable stage 4 chronic renal dysfunction with an eGFR of 23 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. We've been monitoring your condition with serial transthoracic echocardiography at our institution, and it has shown progressive degenerative aortic valve disease. \nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: At your presentation, the transthoracic echocardiography showed degenerative bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps. The appearance of the valve is consistent with severe aortic stenosis, which was confirmed by hemodynamic Doppler assessment. It revealed a peak gradient of 65 mm Hg, an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 derived from the continuity equation, and a dimensionless velocity index of 0.24. Your left ventricular function is normal with an ejection fraction of 59% by Simpson's method.\nPatient: So, what does all that mean, doc?\nDoctor: We performed further evaluation using multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) to assess your aortic valve and aorto-iliac anatomy. It confirmed the morphology of a heavily calcific bicuspid aortic valve and the absence of associated aortopathy. It also showed that you're suitable for a transfemoral approach. The maximal aortic annulus dimension was measured as 25 mm with an aortic root diameter of 32 mm at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva.\nPatient: Okay, and what about my coronary arteries?\nDoctor: We performed coronary angiography to screen for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and did not find any evidence of obstructive coronary disease.\nPatient: That's a relief.\nDoctor: One more thing, upon admission, we noted that you were bradycardic with episodes.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hi there, I heard you've been experiencing some wrist pain and unsightly appearance of your wrist after a previous fracture. Can you please describe how it feels and when these symptoms started to develop?\nPatient: Yeah, the pain is mostly on the ulnar side of my wrist, and it started about a year after the fracture. The appearance of my wrist seems a bit deformed too.\nDoctor: I see. Based on the physical examination and the tests we ran, it appears that you have a growth plate fracture in your right distal radius, specifically a Salter\u2013Harris type II fracture. You were initially treated with cast immobilization and closed reduction, which allowed the fracture to heal. However, the wrist pain and deformity you're experiencing now are due to a condition called partial physeal arrest.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: Partial physeal arrest occurs when the growth plate in your wrist is damaged, causing it to stop growing properly. In your case, radiographs showed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and an abnormal radial inclination of the articular surface. A CT scan was also performed to evaluate the deformity and for preoperative simulation with a low-radiation setting.\nPatient: So, what's the plan to fix this?\nDoctor: We have planned a two-stage operation for you. The first stage will involve a procedure called distraction osteogenesis to gradually lengthen the affected bone. The second stage will be the Langenski\u00f6ld procedure, which aims to remove the physeal bar and reestablish physeal growth.\nPatient: Will this help with the pain and appearance of my wrist?\nDoctor: Yes, the goal of the operation is to correct the deformities of the wrist and improve its appearance and function. In the first operation, we'll use a closed-wedge osteotomy to correct the distal radius, and an external fixator called the Orthofix MiniRail Fixator\u2122 will be used for lengthening.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. What do I need to do to prepare for the surgery?\nDoctor: We have obtained informed consent from your guardians to report the procedure and proceed with the operation.

In your case, radiographs showed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and an abnormal radial inclination of the articular surface. A CT scan was also performed to evaluate the deformity and for preoperative simulation with a low-radiation setting.\nPatient: So, what's the plan to fix this?\nDoctor: We have planned a two-stage operation for you. The first stage will involve a procedure called distraction osteogenesis to gradually lengthen the affected bone. The second stage will be the Langenski\u00f6ld procedure, which aims to remove the physeal bar and reestablish physeal growth.\nPatient: Will this help with the pain and appearance of my wrist?\nDoctor: Yes, the goal of the operation is to correct the deformities of the wrist and improve its appearance and function. In the first operation, we'll use a closed-wedge osteotomy to correct the distal radius, and an external fixator called the Orthofix MiniRail Fixator\u2122 will be used for lengthening.\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good. What do I need to do to prepare for the surgery?\nDoctor: We have obtained informed consent from your guardians to report the procedure and proceed with the operation. All procedures have been approved by the Ethics Committee of our institution, and we will adhere to all of the recommended guidelines for an experimental investigation involving human subjects.\nPatient: Got it. Thank you for explaining everything to me. I'm looking forward to getting this fixed.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We'll be here to support you throughout the process."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports persistent pain on the ulnar side of the right wrist and noticeable deformity, starting approximately one year after a fracture. The patient describes the pain as localized and the wrist as appearing deformed.\nO: Physical examination and diagnostic imaging confirmed a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the right distal radius with subsequent partial physeal arrest. Radiographs revealed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and abnormal radial inclination. A CT scan was performed to further evaluate the deformity and assist in preoperative planning, using a low-radiation setting.\nA: The primary diagnosis is partial physeal arrest secondary to a previously treated Salter-Harris type II fracture of the right distal radius.

I had to undergo a bunch of surgeries like extended left maxillectomy, anterior and middle cranial base resection, left ophthalmectomy, and flap reconstruction using the rectus abdominis muscle.\nDoctor: I see. During your physical examination, I noticed a recessed deformation on the left side of your face due to the left ophthalmectomy. The function of your left levator palpebrae muscle has been eliminated to a slight elevation using the frontal muscle. There's also a metal plate anchored to the inferior wall of your orbit. How have you been managing with these changes?\nPatient: It's been tough, but I'm getting used to it.\nDoctor: I also observed that during the mesh titanium plate reconstruction, your left ethmoid bone, inferior nasal turbinate, maxilla, alisphenoid, medial and lateral pterygoid muscle were excised. Intraorally, your left maxilla has been excised from the midline and the rectus abdominis muscle flap was sutured directly to your soft palate. The peripheral mucous membrane around your left upper lip is scarred, without the oral vestibule. Have you experienced any discomfort or difficulty with this?\nPatient: Yes, sometimes it's uncomfortable and the flap margin has moved along with the surrounding soft tissue.\nDoctor: I see that the 70 \u00d7 50 mm flap is sagging from its weight and is in contact with your mandibular molars, which reduces the volume of your oral cavity unless you wear dentures. Your maxilla has been removed from the midline to the maxillary tuberosity, while your mandible has been removed from the anterior border of the ramus to the coronoid process. Has this caused any issues with your dentures?\nPatient: Yeah, it's been a bit difficult to adjust to them.\nDoctor: During the reconstruction, the dead space was eliminated by placing the abdominal rectus muscle from the anterior cranial base to the oral cavity (Fig.). Have you noticed any expiratory leakage or food reflux?\nPatient: No, I haven't experienced any leakage or food reflux.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Prior to performing surgery, there was no tumor recurrence or metastasis detected.

Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?\nPatient: Sure, doc. I was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary gingiva in May 2005. I had to undergo a bunch of surgeries like extended left maxillectomy, anterior and middle cranial base resection, left ophthalmectomy, and flap reconstruction using the rectus abdominis muscle.\nDoctor: I see. During your physical examination, I noticed a recessed deformation on the left side of your face due to the left ophthalmectomy. The function of your left levator palpebrae muscle has been eliminated to a slight elevation using the frontal muscle. There's also a metal plate anchored to the inferior wall of your orbit. How have you been managing with these changes?\nPatient: It's been tough, but I'm getting used to it.\nDoctor: I also observed that during the mesh titanium plate reconstruction, your left ethmoid bone, inferior nasal turbinate, maxilla, alisphenoid, medial and lateral pterygoid muscle were excised. Intraorally, your left maxilla has been excised from the midline and the rectus abdominis muscle flap was sutured directly to your soft palate. The peripheral mucous membrane around your left upper lip is scarred, without the oral vestibule. Have you experienced any discomfort or difficulty with this?\nPatient: Yes, sometimes it's uncomfortable and the flap margin has moved along with the surrounding soft tissue.\nDoctor: I see that the 70 \u00d7 50 mm flap is sagging from its weight and is in contact with your mandibular molars, which reduces the volume of your oral cavity unless you wear dentures. Your maxilla has been removed from the midline to the maxillary tuberosity, while your mandible has been removed from the anterior border of the ramus to the coronoid process. Has this caused any issues with your dentures?\nPatient: Yeah, it's been a bit difficult to adjust to them.\nDoctor: During the reconstruction, the dead space was eliminated by placing the abdominal rectus muscle from the anterior cranial base to the oral cavity (Fig.). Have you noticed any expiratory leakage or food reflux?\nPatient: No, I haven't experienced any leakage or food reflux.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Prior to performing surgery, there was no tumor recurrence or metastasis detected. Have you been keeping up with your follow-up appointments to monitor your condition?\nPatient: Yes, I have been attending all my follow-up appointments.\nDoctor: Great. I also see that you have a mouth opening of 43 mm. Are you experiencing any difficulties with this mouth opening size?\nPatient: Not really, I can manage with it.\nDoctor: Alright. Based on our conversation and my examination, we will work on improving your denture retention and stability. We may need to make adjustments to your current dentures or consider other options to ensure your comfort and proper function. Please continue to attend your follow-up appointments so we can monitor your condition closely.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient, referred by a head and neck surgeon, reports difficulties with upper denture retention and stability following extensive surgeries for squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary gingiva diagnosed in May 2005.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello there, can you please tell me why you have come in today?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. I'm a 13-year-old boy and I've been experiencing headaches, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 weeks.\nDoctor: I see. Let's take a closer look at your condition. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your brain and spinal cord, which revealed a left cerebellar expansive lesion. However, there is no evidence of metastasis.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also conducted a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and fortunately, there is no evidence of dissemination. You underwent complete surgical resection as confirmed by postoperative imaging to remove the lesion.\nPatient: So the surgery went well then?\nDoctor: Yes, the surgery was successful. After that, we performed a histopathological analysis, including reticulin staining, which revealed a desmoplastic\/nodular MB. There was no diffuse severe cytological anaplasia present.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor is a specific type, and it's not as aggressive as some other types. We also performed complementary immunophenotypic characterization, which suggested a MB with SHH activation and TP53 wild-type. The nuclear INI-1 staining was preserved, and P53 immunostaining showed nuclear positivity only in a small proportion of the tumor cells.\nPatient: Okay, I hope that's a good sign.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. There was no evidence of MYCN or MYCC amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). We conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) over a panel of 50 genes using the Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, which revealed an IDH1 R132C mutation in 46% of cells.\nPatient: What about the other genes?\nDoctor: We repeated the NGS with a panel of 400 genes using the Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Comprehensive Cancer Panel, and it revealed IDH1 R132C mutation in 24% of cells, SMARCB1-R201G in 30% of cells, and CDH11-L625T in 26% of cells. The panel was tested on both tumor and normal tissue to confirm the somatic nature of the mutations.\nPatient: Were there any other mutations detected?\nDoctor: No, mutations in SMO, PTCH1, SUFU, and TP53 were not detected. The Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k) array revealed the highest resemblance to the methylation class MB, subclass SHH A (children and adult). The calibrated score further supported these findings.\nPatient: So what's the next step, doctor?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide any necessary follow-up care. Since the surgery was successful and the tumor type is less aggressive, there is reason to be optimistic about your prognosis.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor, for explaining everything to me.

I'm a 13-year-old boy and I've been experiencing headaches, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 weeks.\nDoctor: I see. Let's take a closer look at your condition. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of your brain and spinal cord, which revealed a left cerebellar expansive lesion. However, there is no evidence of metastasis.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also conducted a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and fortunately, there is no evidence of dissemination. You underwent complete surgical resection as confirmed by postoperative imaging to remove the lesion.\nPatient: So the surgery went well then?\nDoctor: Yes, the surgery was successful. After that, we performed a histopathological analysis, including reticulin staining, which revealed a desmoplastic\/nodular MB. There was no diffuse severe cytological anaplasia present.\nPatient: What does that mean, doctor?\nDoctor: It means that the tumor is a specific type, and it's not as aggressive as some other types. We also performed complementary immunophenotypic characterization, which suggested a MB with SHH activation and TP53 wild-type. The nuclear INI-1 staining was preserved, and P53 immunostaining showed nuclear positivity only in a small proportion of the tumor cells.\nPatient: Okay, I hope that's a good sign.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. There was no evidence of MYCN or MYCC amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). We conducted next-generation sequencing (NGS) over a panel of 50 genes using the Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, which revealed an IDH1 R132C mutation in 46% of cells.\nPatient: What about the other genes?\nDoctor: We repeated the NGS with a panel of 400 genes using the Ion AmpliSeq\u2122 Comprehensive Cancer Panel, and it revealed IDH1 R132C mutation in 24% of cells, SMARCB1-R201G in 30% of cells, and CDH11-L625T in 26% of cells. The panel was tested on both tumor and normal tissue to confirm the somatic nature of the mutations.\nPatient: Were there any other mutations detected?\nDoctor: No, mutations in SMO, PTCH1, SUFU, and TP53 were not detected. The Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850k) array revealed the highest resemblance to the methylation class MB, subclass SHH A (children and adult). The calibrated score further supported these findings.\nPatient: So what's the next step, doctor?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide any necessary follow-up care. Since the surgery was successful and the tumor type is less aggressive, there is reason to be optimistic about your prognosis.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor, for explaining everything to me. I appreciate your help."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient, a 13-year-old boy, reports experiencing headaches, nausea, and vomiting for the past 2 weeks.

Let me perform a physical exam to check for any signs of appendicitis. Have you experienced any similar symptoms in the past?\nPatient: Yes, five years ago I had diffuse abdominal pain and a CT scan identified a lesion in my small bowel. The endoscopic biopsy showed it was GIST.\nDoctor: Did you undergo any treatment for that?\nPatient: I had a resection without complications. No pathology was available, and according to me, no adjuvant chemotherapy was given. I was symptom-free for the next several years.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. I'll need to perform some tests to check for any signs of recurrence. In the meantime, I'll also check your white blood cell count.\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\n[later]\nDoctor: Your white blood cell count is elevated at 16.5, and the CT scan shows signs of appendicitis as well as suspicious masses in the abdominal area. We'll need to consider nonoperative management and further workup. Let's have a discussion about the next steps.\nPatient: What do you think might be happening?\nDoctor: Based on the findings, the right lower quadrant masses are most concerning for recurrent GIST. We'll need to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to confirm this and plan for surgery.\nPatient: Okay, let's do the surgery.\n[later, after surgery]\nDoctor: I wanted to update you on the surgery. During the diagnostic laparoscopy, we found that the appendix wall was thickened and acutely inflamed with nodular lesions. We also found multiple nodules on the terminal ileum and the parietal peritoneum of the anterior and lateral abdominal walls.\nPatient: Were you able to remove them all?\nDoctor: We removed most of them, but one larger nodule in the right pelvis couldn't be mobilized. Due to the volume of the separate masses, we had to convert the case to a laparotomy. We made a lower midline incision, secured the mesoappendix with a stapler, and resected the appendix.\nPatient: What about the other nodules and the terminal ileum?\nDoctor: We removed all visible nodules from the peritoneum and performed a partial resection of the terminal ileum.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?\nPatient: Hi, I've been having some pain in my kidney area and my doctor told me I might have a staghorn calculus.\nDoctor: I see. Based on your condition, you might need a nephro-ureterostomy stent placement. This procedure will help alleviate your symptoms. We'll use fluoroscopic guidance to accurately place the stent.\nPatient: Hmm, how does that work?\nDoctor: First, we'll introduce a 21-gauge needle through your skin into an inferior renal calyx. Then, we'll perform an antegrade pyelogram to visualize the opacification of your collecting system.\nPatient: Okay, and what happens after that?\nDoctor: After demonstrating the return of urine, we'll pass a wire through the needle and introduce a dilator over the wire. We may use multiple catheters and wires to attempt to gain access to the collecting system.\nPatient: Alright, and how long does the procedure usually take?\nDoctor: It varies for each patient but could take around two hours. In some cases, we might have to abandon the procedure if we can't access the central renal pelvis due to the obstructive staghorn calculus.

Then, we'll exchange the SMC for a 4-French Berenstein catheter and place an 8.5-French nephro-ureterostomy stent from Cook Medical.\nPatient: And where will the stent be placed?\nDoctor: The distal loop of the stent will be formed in your urinary bladder. However, due to the space-occupying staghorn calculus, we might be unable to form the proximal loop in the renal pelvis.

They checked my leg and found a 1 cm wound with some grass in it.\nDoctor: It looks like they performed a neurovascular assessment and didn't find any deficits, which is good. And they did an initial inspection of your leg to assess the wound. Did they do any treatment at that point?\nPatient: Yes, they cleaned the wound with irrigation and gave me IV cefazolin, gentamicin, and penicillin. They also applied a splint to my leg.\nDoctor: Good, those initial treatments are important. I see that you underwent intraoperative irrigation and debridement within the first 24 hours, and they placed a suprapatellar IMN. How did you feel after the surgery?\nPatient: I was okay at first. They gave me two doses of IV Ancef, and I was discharged with a nonweightbearing status on my injured leg.\nDoctor: I understand that you started to develop progressive knee discomfort over time. Can you describe the symptoms and when they began?\nPatient: Yeah, after about four weeks, I started to have severe pain in my knee. It got really swollen and red, and I could hardly move it.\nDoctor: It appears that at that juncture, an examination identified a large knee effusion, erythema, and minimal tolerance for knee range-of-motion. They also inspected the fracture site and found mild erythema with serosanguinous drainage. They aspirated the knee and found cloudy yellow fluid. The analysis showed a white cell count of over 100,000 with 96% neutrophils, and the cultures grew gram-negative rods. Your care was then transferred to me. \nPatient: Yeah, that's when things started to get really serious.\nDoctor: We decided to perform an I&D of the knee, fracture site, and intramedullary canal after removing the hardware. During the procedure, we found discolored fluid in the knee and palpable loculations in the suprapatellar pouch. We also found grass in the knee and at the fracture site. \nPatient: That must be why my knee was so infected.\nDoctor: Yes, the grass likely contributed to the infection. We performed a synovectomy to remove the loculated tissue in the knee, and we extended the surgical footprint at the fracture site to allow for debridement of the bone and soft tissue. We removed nonviable skin, which resulted in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect directly over the anteromedial tibial fracture site. \nPatient: What is the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: We used a reamed irrigator aspirator (RIA) during the procedure, which will help with recovery. Going forward, we will closely monitor your healing process and address any complications that may arise. It's important that you continue to follow the nonweightbearing status on your injured leg and follow up with us regularly.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.

Can you tell me what happened and what kind of injuries you sustained?\nPatient: Yeah, I had a pretty bad crash and ended up with a type II distal diaphyseal tibia fracture and a segmental fibula fracture. They checked my leg and found a 1 cm wound with some grass in it.\nDoctor: It looks like they performed a neurovascular assessment and didn't find any deficits, which is good. And they did an initial inspection of your leg to assess the wound. Did they do any treatment at that point?\nPatient: Yes, they cleaned the wound with irrigation and gave me IV cefazolin, gentamicin, and penicillin. They also applied a splint to my leg.\nDoctor: Good, those initial treatments are important. I see that you underwent intraoperative irrigation and debridement within the first 24 hours, and they placed a suprapatellar IMN. How did you feel after the surgery?\nPatient: I was okay at first. They gave me two doses of IV Ancef, and I was discharged with a nonweightbearing status on my injured leg.\nDoctor: I understand that you started to develop progressive knee discomfort over time. Can you describe the symptoms and when they began?\nPatient: Yeah, after about four weeks, I started to have severe pain in my knee. It got really swollen and red, and I could hardly move it.\nDoctor: It appears that at that juncture, an examination identified a large knee effusion, erythema, and minimal tolerance for knee range-of-motion. They also inspected the fracture site and found mild erythema with serosanguinous drainage. They aspirated the knee and found cloudy yellow fluid. The analysis showed a white cell count of over 100,000 with 96% neutrophils, and the cultures grew gram-negative rods. Your care was then transferred to me. \nPatient: Yeah, that's when things started to get really serious.\nDoctor: We decided to perform an I&D of the knee, fracture site, and intramedullary canal after removing the hardware. During the procedure, we found discolored fluid in the knee and palpable loculations in the suprapatellar pouch. We also found grass in the knee and at the fracture site. \nPatient: That must be why my knee was so infected.\nDoctor: Yes, the grass likely contributed to the infection. We performed a synovectomy to remove the loculated tissue in the knee, and we extended the surgical footprint at the fracture site to allow for debridement of the bone and soft tissue. We removed nonviable skin, which resulted in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect directly over the anteromedial tibial fracture site. \nPatient: What is the next step in my treatment?\nDoctor: We used a reamed irrigator aspirator (RIA) during the procedure, which will help with recovery. Going forward, we will closely monitor your healing process and address any complications that may arise. It's important that you continue to follow the nonweightbearing status on your injured leg and follow up with us regularly.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. I'll make sure to follow your instructions and come in for regular check-ups.\nDoctor: Great, that's very important for your recovery. We'll do our best to get you back on your feet as soon as possible."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports a history of a dirt bike accident resulting in a type II distal diaphyseal tibia fracture and a segmental fibula fracture.

Have you had any history of liver disease?\nPatient: No, I've never had any liver problems before.\nDoctor: Your total serum bilirubin level was 3.4 mg\/dl at the time of transplantation, and it peaked on treatment day 24 at 22 mg\/dl. We performed imaging and discovered ascites, which is fluid in your abdominal cavity. We also conducted a liver biopsy on treatment day 16, which was consistent with SOS (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome).\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What are the next steps in my treatment?\nDoctor: We have started treating you with ursodiol, a medication that helps protect the liver. Unfortunately, your condition has worsened, and we were hoping to get defibrotide for you under compassionate use. \nPatient: So, when can I start the defibrotide treatment?\nDoctor: I'm sorry to inform you that we were unable to secure the defibrotide in time. Your loved one passed away on treatment day 25. Our deepest condolences to you and your family.\nFamily Member: Thank you, Doctor.

Irrigation will be done using 1.3% sodium hypochlorite and 17% EDTA. Obturation will be performed using gutta-percha with a cold lateral condensation technique, followed by restoration of the cavity with composite resin. A post-obturation radiograph will be taken to confirm the adequacy of the treatment. The patient will be scheduled for a 6-month follow-up to monitor the treatment outcome and ensure the absence of symptoms or pathology."}]}

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you have a history of acute inflammatory demyelinating process and have recently been experiencing a mass in your left hand. Can you tell me more about when you first noticed it?\nPatient: Yeah, about 3 months ago, I started feeling this mass on my left wrist and the hypothenar area of my hand. It's been getting more and more uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I see. You were admitted to the hospital with generalized weakness, ataxia, and multiple sensory deficits, including a complete lack of sensation in your left small finger and the ulnar side of your hand. Can you tell me more about these symptoms?\nPatient: Sure, I've been feeling really weak and unsteady, and I've lost all feeling in my left pinky and the side of my hand. It's been really difficult to do things with my left hand.\nDoctor: We initially thought that the sensory deficits were related to your demyelinating disorder, but upon examination, we believe that the ulnar deficit is related to the mass in your hand. The mass is soft, nontender, and doesn't limit your range of motion. Your grip strength seems decreased compared to your other hand, though we haven't measured it objectively yet. Have you experienced any trauma, previous surgeries, or other masses in the past?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trauma or surgeries, and I've never had any other masses before.\nDoctor: We've also done radiographs of your left upper extremity, which appeared normal. Our initial diagnosis is that the mass could be a lipoma. We conducted a magnetic resonance angiography of your left hand to get a better understanding of the mass, but its etiology is still unclear (Fig. ).\nPatient: Hmm, so what's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We performed an operative excision under general anesthesia to remove the mass. We made a longitudinally oriented ulnar-sided skin incision, dissected the palmar fascia, and released Guyon's canal. The mass was found to be arising from beneath the hypothenar musculature, and it appeared tan-white, rubbery, and lobulated (Fig. ).\nPatient: What did the pathology report say?\nDoctor: The pathology report confirmed that the mass is a benign myxoma (Fig. ). There were no postoperative complications, which is a good sign.\nPatient: That's a relief. How am I recovering from the surgery?\nDoctor: At 5 weeks postoperatively, you reported marked improvement in your numbness and weakness. We found that you have intact sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution distal to the site of the excised mass, and your grip strength has improved.\nPatient: That's great to hear! What do I need to do now?\nDoctor: We would like you to return in several months for a repeat sensorimotor assessment. However, I understand that you were subsequently lost to follow-up. It's important that we continue to monitor your progress and ensure that there are no further issues.\nPatient: Okay, I'll make sure to schedule an appointment for the assessment.

Can you tell me more about when you first noticed it?\nPatient: Yeah, about 3 months ago, I started feeling this mass on my left wrist and the hypothenar area of my hand. It's been getting more and more uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I see. You were admitted to the hospital with generalized weakness, ataxia, and multiple sensory deficits, including a complete lack of sensation in your left small finger and the ulnar side of your hand. Can you tell me more about these symptoms?\nPatient: Sure, I've been feeling really weak and unsteady, and I've lost all feeling in my left pinky and the side of my hand. It's been really difficult to do things with my left hand.\nDoctor: We initially thought that the sensory deficits were related to your demyelinating disorder, but upon examination, we believe that the ulnar deficit is related to the mass in your hand. The mass is soft, nontender, and doesn't limit your range of motion. Your grip strength seems decreased compared to your other hand, though we haven't measured it objectively yet. Have you experienced any trauma, previous surgeries, or other masses in the past?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any trauma or surgeries, and I've never had any other masses before.\nDoctor: We've also done radiographs of your left upper extremity, which appeared normal. Our initial diagnosis is that the mass could be a lipoma. We conducted a magnetic resonance angiography of your left hand to get a better understanding of the mass, but its etiology is still unclear (Fig. ).\nPatient: Hmm, so what's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We performed an operative excision under general anesthesia to remove the mass. We made a longitudinally oriented ulnar-sided skin incision, dissected the palmar fascia, and released Guyon's canal. The mass was found to be arising from beneath the hypothenar musculature, and it appeared tan-white, rubbery, and lobulated (Fig. ).\nPatient: What did the pathology report say?\nDoctor: The pathology report confirmed that the mass is a benign myxoma (Fig. ). There were no postoperative complications, which is a good sign.\nPatient: That's a relief. How am I recovering from the surgery?\nDoctor: At 5 weeks postoperatively, you reported marked improvement in your numbness and weakness. We found that you have intact sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution distal to the site of the excised mass, and your grip strength has improved.\nPatient: That's great to hear! What do I need to do now?\nDoctor: We would like you to return in several months for a repeat sensorimotor assessment. However, I understand that you were subsequently lost to follow-up. It's important that we continue to monitor your progress and ensure that there are no further issues.\nPatient: Okay, I'll make sure to schedule an appointment for the assessment.

We need to do a further computed tomography (CT) scan of your kidneys, ureters, and bladder to get a clearer picture of what's going on.\nPatient: Alright, let's do it.\n[After CT scan]\nDoctor: The CT scan showed a dilatation of the ureter up to the vesicoureteric junction with an associated tight stricture. We'll need to perform a right rigid ureteroscopy, ureteric biopsy, and ureteric stent insertion to get a better understanding of the issue.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n[After procedure]\nDoctor: The histology report from the biopsy shows that you have transitional cell carcinoma of the ureter. Initially, we didn't perform any neuroendocrine markers because the tumor didn't show any classical signs of a carcinoid tumor or a well-differentiated small cell carcinoma. However, further examination revealed an atypical carcinoid pattern.\nPatient: Oh no, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We did some further imaging of your chest and fortunately, we didn't find any distant metastases. Our plan is to perform a right laparoscopic nephroureterectomy and open excision of the bladder cuff to remove the tumor.\nPatient: I'm glad there's a plan in place. Let's do what needs to be done.\n[After surgery]\nDoctor: The surgery went well. The tumor in your ureter was about 18 mm long, and we were able to achieve a clear resection margin of at least 4 mm. Microscopy of the ureteric specimen showed a positive immunohistochemical stain with CD56, a common neuroendocrine marker. Staining with other neuroendocrine markers was weakly positive. The tumor was intermediate to high grade, with a high Ki-67 proliferation index of 25 to 30%. We didn't find any associated carcinoma in situ or definite lymphovascular invasion.\nPatient: That's a relief. What does that mean for my recovery?\nDoctor: The tumor infiltrated through the muscle into the periureteric fat, which is a T3 stage. Your kidney showed patchy lymphocytic infiltrates, indicating mild interstitial nephritis, but there was no tumor infiltration into the kidney or the urothelium covering the renal pelvis.\nPatient: So, what are the next steps?\nDoctor: You made an unremarkable recovery from the surgery. As you remain well and your chromogranin levels are only mildly elevated and stable, the oncologist decided that there's no need for adjuvant therapy at this time. We'll continue to monitor your condition closely.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all your help."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient presented with right-sided loin pain and microscopic hematuria, without any urinary symptoms.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, I'm glad you're here today for a follow-up regarding your long-standing daytime sleepiness. Can you describe your sleepiness episodes and how they affect your daily life?\nPatient: Yeah, I often experience sudden onsets of sleep, even while standing up, and sometimes I lose up to 30 minutes. It's been really frustrating.\nDoctor: I see. Do you ever have cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, or sleep paralysis during these episodes?\nPatient: No, I don't have any of those.\nDoctor: Okay. I have your initial evaluation report from 1993, which indicated that you had 32 awakenings, 2 apnea\/hypopnea spells, and a mean sleep onset of 5.9 minutes during the sleep studies. You were also observed to enter REM sleep in at least two and possibly four of the five naps. Did anything change since then?\nPatient: I moved and went to your sleep disorders center in 2004 with the same complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness. I wasn't on any specific treatment at that time.\nDoctor: Thanks for the information. Did you experience any sleepwalking episodes during this time?\nPatient: Yes, I had some episodes where I was walking on the roof of a chemical plant where I worked or even smoking a cigarette on my front porch.\nDoctor: I see that an overnight polysomnogram (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) were performed in 2004. There was no significant sleep-disordered breathing, abnormal increase in muscle tone, or unusual activity during REM or non-REM sleep. Sleep occurred on all four nap opportunities, with a mean sleep latency of 10 minutes and no sleep onset REM periods. Were you given any treatments after these tests?\nPatient: Yes, I was given stimulant medications and advised to extend my nocturnal sleep period. Methylphenidate at 20 mg per day didn't help much, and higher doses up to 60 mg per day made me irritable and angry. I also tried modafinil, but I couldn't tolerate it because of gastrointestinal effects.\nDoctor: I understand. I have the results of the repeat PSG and MSLT performed in 2008. The PSG showed excellent sleep efficiency at 96.5%, normal REM latency of 93.5 minutes, REM sleep comprising 16.8% of total sleep time, and normal slow wave sleep.

Arterial blood gas analysis showed mixed metabolic\/respiratory acidosis (pH 7.1, pCO2 55 mmHg, bicarbonate 20 mEq\/L). Laboratory tests revealed a white cell count of 15.6 \u00d7 10^9\/\u00b5L with 76% neutrophils, thrombocytosis (605 \u00d7 10^9\/\u00b5L), and an INR of 1.24. Chest radiograph was normal. A CT scan and MRI identified a 27 mm \u00d7 47 mm \u00d7 42 mm parapharyngeal\/paravertebral cystic mass obstructing the oropharyngeal airway and acute left LST. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the mass yielded pus.\nA: The primary diagnoses are severe pneumonia, sepsis, and a parapharyngeal\/paravertebral cystic mass causing airway obstruction, with complications including generalized convulsions and acute left LST. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of respiratory distress and convulsions in infants.\nP: The patient was intubated and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clarithromycin), anticonvulsants (phenytoin), and analgesics (morphine). Treatment for the cystic mass included drainage and flushing with gentamicin. Enoxaparin was initiated for acute left LST. Ongoing management will include close monitoring in the ICU, adjustments to therapy as needed, and further diagnostic evaluations to assess the progression or resolution of the identified conditions."}]}

No pain on the left side at all.\nDoctor: I also observed that there's no cystic lesion on your left knee. Your right infrapatellar region is larger than normal and feels firm. Your passive full knee range of motion is possible, but painful. There's no tenderness on your tibial tubercle or patella.\nPatient: Hmm, what do you think is causing this?\nDoctor: I've reviewed your plain radiographic examination, and it shows a large ossicle beneath the patellar tendon and inside the infrapatellar fat pad in your right knee. Interestingly, there's a similar-sized ossicle in your left knee, partially fused to the hypertrophied tibial tuberosity.\nPatient: What about the MRI results?\nDoctor: Your right knee magnetic resonance images show a 3.8 x 1.3 x 3.0 cm sized, well-circumscribed ossicle. There are several smaller ossicles near the tibial tubercle as well. Inflammatory changes in synovium, infrapatellar fat pad, and patellar tendon are also visible. A reactive bone marrow edema was found at the anterior aspect of the tibial condyle.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: Based on your symptoms and test results, we'll discuss a treatment plan that may include medication, additional therapy, or even surgery if necessary. We will closely monitor your progress and make adjustments as needed. It's important to follow up regularly and report any changes in your symptoms.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for your help, Doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll work together to get you back on your feet as soon as possible."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient is a 45-year-old English teacher who reports suffering from right knee pain for approximately one year, worsening eight months ago.

In that case, let me check your vital signs. We need to find out what's causing this shock. Have you had any recent medical issues?\nPatient: Yes, I was hospitalized a month ago in your department and underwent a patch repair for a gastric ulcer perforation.\nDoctor: Alright, let's perform a contrast-enhanced CT scan to get more information. \n(After CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in your pancreatic head, aneurysm formation in the PDA, and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk. Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA, but no liquid was retained in your peritoneal cavity.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What should we do?\nDoctor: We will perform an emergent IVR for hemostasis to address the retroperitoneal hemorrhage from the ruptured PDA aneurysm. Arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) will be done through a sheath introduced in your right femoral artery.\nPatient: Okay, go ahead.\n(After the procedure)\nDoctor: The imaging of the SMA revealed the development of several collaterals in your pancreatic head, and the common and proper hepatic arteries were imaged via these collaterals. The aneurysm in your PDA had leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent with a diameter of 9.3 mm. We have completed the IVR hemostasis by performing PDA coil embolization.\nPatient: So, what's next?\nDoctor: We will conduct SMA arteriography to see the other collaterals perfusing your proper hepatic artery. After the IVR therapy, we will monitor your blood chemical analysis for several weeks to ensure that your transaminase level is not elevated and hepatic infarction is negative.\nPatient: Got it. And what about the obstruction caused by the hematoma?\nDoctor: We observed obstruction of the duodenal passage resulting from the hematoma for a few weeks. However, bypass surgery was not required as the obstruction was completely relieved as the hematoma was naturally and gradually absorbed.\nPatient: That's a relief. What could have caused all this?\nDoctor: In your case, collateral perfusion pathways from the SMA developed to compensate for the reduced CA blood flow due to MAL compression, and the aneurysm might have been generated in the PDA due to the abnormal changes in hemodynamic flow. Preservative treatment did not appear to relieve the CA compression. Additionally, we considered that new aneurysms may form following new collateral circulation after IVR hemostasis.\nPatient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything, doctor.

Is it under control?\nPatient: Yes, I've been managing it well.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. I have reviewed your anterior rhinoscopic and endoscopic nasal examination results, and there were no pathological findings. However, your nasal septum is deviated to the left. Your hematological and biochemical parameters are normal, which is a good sign.\nPatient: Oh, okay. So, what's causing the pain then?\nDoctor: We performed a paranasal computed tomography (PNCT) imaging, and it revealed concha bullosa variation of the bilateral middle turbinates, and soft tissue density in the right concha bullosa. We then incised the concha bullosa by applying topical anesthesia to your right nasal cavity and performed a punch biopsy.\nPatient: Hmm, and what did the pathology report say?\nDoctor: The pathology report concluded that there were fungal hyphae and necrobiotic material. So, we prepared you for surgery. After receiving your written consent, we planned an endoscopic sinus surgery under general anesthesia.\nPatient: I remember that. How did the surgery go?\nDoctor: The surgery went well. We excised the lateral and inferior lamellae of the concha bullosa and submitted the infected material inside for pathologic examination. We controlled the bleeding, and the intervention was finalized.\nPatient: That's a relief. What was my post-operative treatment?\nDoctor: We prescribed a nasal wash and anti-inflammatory treatment for you. The pathological examination report revealed fungal organisms and their hyphae in the necrobiotic material. An advanced microbiological examination cultured \"Aspergillus oryzae\" through sequential analysis of the ribosomal DNA genes in the aspirated material.\nPatient: So, how am I doing now?\nDoctor: During your post-operative 6-month follow-up, we observed that your headache complaints were diminished and your nasal passage was open. It seems like the surgery and treatment have been successful.\nPatient: That's great to hear! Thank you so much, doctor."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports sustained hemifacial pain on the right side, which has been persistent for a while.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've been feeling weak in my legs for the past week, and I've been experiencing some tingling sensations too. I've also noticed that I need to go to the bathroom more frequently.\nDoctor: I see. Have you had any recent symptoms of infections, trauma, or accidents?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any of those.\nDoctor: Okay, let's discuss your past medical history. Do you have any family history of significant concern?\nPatient: No, my family history is clear.\nDoctor: Are you a non-smoker and teetotaler? And have you been exposed to any environmental factors such as industrial chemicals, radiation, heavy metals, or any toxin exposures?\nPatient: Yes, I am a non-smoker and teetotaler. I haven't been exposed to any harmful substances like that.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Moving on, you mentioned that you lead an active life and used to live with your partner. Your Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 1 before admission. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: On your examination, we found symmetrical lower limb motor weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern with Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle power 4\/5 both proximally and distally. We also observed reduced sensations in your lower limbs symmetrically to fine touch, pinprick, temperature, and proprioception, which progressed to significant sensory loss over the next couple of weeks. Your sensory level is slightly below the umbilicus at T11. However, there was no spinal tenderness. Do you have any questions so far?\nPatient: No, I understand. Thank you for explaining.\nDoctor: Additionally, your deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were exaggerated with extensor plantar responses. The rest of your general and systemic examination was unremarkable. We conducted blood tests, including full blood count, inflammatory markers, B12, folate, thyroid functions, calcium, liver function test, and myeloma screen, which all came back normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on the second day after admission was also normal with normal protein, glucose, and cytology, etc. Have you had any concerns about these tests?\nPatient: No, I'm glad everything was normal.\nDoctor: Finally, we evaluated you with a non-contrast MRI spine, which showed focal myelopathic cord signal at the conus and at the level of T10 and T11 vertebrae. The radiological differential diagnosis on MRI includes B12 deficiency, inflammatory, or infection-related causes. We will continue to investigate and monitor your condition closely. It's important that you follow up with us as needed and adhere to any recommendations we provide. Do you have any questions or concerns?\nPatient: No, I appreciate all the information. I'll be sure to follow your recommendations. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll continue to work together to manage your symptoms and find the best course of treatment for you. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient reports a gradual onset of painless lower limb weakness, paresthesias, and increased urinary frequency over the past week.

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hi, I see that you've presented to the emergency room with a complaint of a severe headache for 1 day. Can you tell me more about your headache?\nPatient: Yes, it's been a throbbing headache with photophobia, and I've had multiple episodes of nonbloody vomiting.\nDoctor: I see. You've reported a history of closed head trauma and intermittent rhinorrhea, especially when leaning forward, which resolved a few months prior to this presentation. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: You also mentioned a history of intermittent migraines and coronary artery disease. Is there anything else I should be aware of?\nPatient: No, I think that's everything.\nDoctor: Okay, let's discuss your physical examination. You had photophobia, but no nuchal rigidity or focal motor or sensory neurological deficits were found. Your vital signs were also unremarkable. We did some laboratory tests and found that your hemoglobin was 11.6 g\/dl, your white cell count (WBC) was 13.1 \u00d7 10^9\/1 with 84.7% neutrophils, serum sodium was 138 mEq\/l, potassium was 4.1 mEq\/l, and creatinine was 0.7 mg\/dl. All your liver function tests were within normal limits.\nPatient: Okay, that's good to know.\nDoctor: We admitted you to the medical floor and performed a lumbar puncture. The opening pressure was 35 cm H2O, and the CSF fluid analysis showed a WBC of 1850 cells\/uL with 70% segmental, red blood cells at 5, protein at 175 mg\/dl which is higher than the normal range of 15-45 mg\/dl, and glucose at 40 mg\/dl which is within the normal range of 40-70 mg\/dl. The cryptococcal CSF antigen was detected with a titer of 1 : 1024, which is higher than the normal range of < 1 : 2 titer.

She reports being asymptomatic between episodes, with no history of fever, pruritus, malaise, abdominal pain, blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse, chronic drug intake, or exposure to occupational hazards. She is a non-alcoholic and non-smoker.\nO: Patient's pre-pregnancy bilirubin levels were 3.0-4.0 mg\/dL (normal 0.1-1.2 mg\/dL), rising to 11.0-12.0 mg\/dL during pregnancy with conjugated bilirubin levels of 8.0-10.0 mg\/dL and unconjugated bilirubin of 2.0-3.0 mg\/dL. Liver function tests normal, with serum transaminase levels <20 IU\/L, and normal serum bile acid levels and proteins. Ultrasound showed normal liver span and echotexture. Viral markers for hepatitis were negative.\nA: The patient exhibits recurrent pregnancy-related conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with normal liver function and structure. Differential diagnoses such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and thrombotic microangiopathies have been ruled out due to the absence of pruritus, normal bile acid levels, normal serum transaminases, and lack of hemolysis on peripheral smear.\nP: Plan to monitor bilirubin levels and liver function closely in future pregnancies. Regular prenatal check-ups are recommended. Consultation with a hepatologist or a specialist in maternal-fetal medicine may be beneficial to further evaluate and manage her condition. Patient education on signs and symptoms that should prompt immediate medical consultation is crucial."}]}

However, you were re-evaluated due to being unresponsive to treatment within this period. Is that all correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: It seems that trans-abdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography were performed and showed multiple multiloculated cystic masses with predominantly solid components in both adnexa. Cross-sectional CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging suggested ovarian neoplasm, and they also detected massive peritoneal and pleural effusion. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Four months after management of hyperstimulation syndrome, due to persistent large ovarian mass and increased tumor marker inhibin more than 3000 pg\/mL, you were referred to our oncology department. During your physical examination, they demonstrated enlarged masses extended up to the hypogastric region, which resembled 36 weeks of pregnancy. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: An exploratory laparotomy was performed, which showed massive ascites fluid and multi solid cystic masses in both ovaries extended up to the Xiphoid. They performed a complete resection of the tumor. The pathology report of the frozen section was unable to confirm malignancy, but permanent histology indicated tumor cells with round-to-ovoid nuclei and eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm. Is that what you were informed?\nPatient: Yes, that's what they told me.\nDoctor: Based on your history and the results of your tests, we will continue to monitor and manage your condition in our oncology department. We'll make sure to provide the best possible care and keep you informed of any updates or changes in your treatment plan.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all your help and support.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us.

Any significant occupational, chemical, or animal exposure? Also, do you have any risk factors for HIV?\nPatient: No, none of those things apply to me.\nDoctor: Alright, let's proceed with a physical examination. *After examination* You are afebrile and have normal vital signs. I did notice a palpable spleen but no other organomegaly. There was no tenderness, guarding, or rigidity. Your chest, cardiovascular, genital, neurologic, and extremities examinations were unremarkable.\nPatient: Okay, so what's next?\nDoctor: We'll need to conduct some laboratory studies. *After studies* Your leukocyte count is 15,000 \u00d7 109\/L, and your eosinophil count is 800 cells \u00d7 109\/L, which is higher than the normal level of less than 500 \u00d7 109\/L. All other parameters of the complete blood count and differential markers of renal and hepatic function, including serum calcium, are within normal limits.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: We also performed a chest radiograph, which showed no consolidation, effusion, or cardiomegaly. An abdominal ultrasound was done, but it was nondiagnostic. However, abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed the presence of an enlarged spleen measuring 16 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6 cm with multiple hypodense lesions. The liver was reported to be normal without any evidence of hepatomegaly. No lymphadenopathy was seen on the imaging studies.\nPatient: That doesn't sound good.

It is indeed suspicious for lung malignancy, so we need to investigate further.\nPatient: Okay, so what's the plan for this biopsy?\nDoctor: We will place you in a prone position and visualize the lung parenchyma in the posterior lateral left chest. Under CT guidance, we'll use a 19-gauge guide to obtain two separate 20-gauge core biopsy specimens from the mass.\nPatient: Hmm, sounds a bit complicated. Are there any risks?\nDoctor: There's always a small risk of complications, such as hemorrhage. But we'll be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure to ensure your safety.\nPatient: Alright, let's do it then.\n[After the biopsy procedure]\nDoctor: The biopsy went well, and there was no hemorrhage or immediate post-procedure complications. However, towards the end of the procedure, you started complaining of chest pain and became unconscious. We couldn't find any palpable pulses, so we called a code blue and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation according to Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines.\nPatient: Oh my, what happened next?\nDoctor: You demonstrated ventricular fibrillation, which responded to defibrillation shock and epinephrine. We performed three cycles of chest compressions, administered one dose of epinephrine, and delivered a shock of 200 J. You were successfully resuscitated and intubated for mechanical ventilation.\nPatient: Wow, that sounds intense. What caused all that?\nDoctor: A CT scan of the chest after the resuscitation showed development of a small anechoic area in the left cardiac ventricle, consistent with an air embolus. That's likely what caused the sudden onset of chest pain and unconsciousness.\nPatient: Oh, I see. How are my vital signs now?\nDoctor: Your vital signs recorded at the time were blood pressure of 130\/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and normal oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. You were admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.\nPatient: Did they find any more problems?\nDoctor: A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram didn't reveal any evidence of an air embolus, and no cardiac wall motion abnormalities were noted. You remained hemodynamically stable for 24 hours.\nPatient: So, what's next for me?\nDoctor: You were successfully weaned off the mechanical ventilator the next day, and you've been discharged home in a stable condition.

Your family has a history of arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Have you ever used alcohol or tobacco?\nPatient: No, I have never used alcohol or tobacco.\nDoctor: Alright. I see that your elevated alkaline phosphatase level was first noticed in 2013, along with some vague abdominal pain. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed hepatic steatosis. Your viral serologies for hepatitis were negative. A gastrointestinal consult was required to determine the need for a liver biopsy. Can you tell me more about the pain you were experiencing?\nPatient: Yes, the abdominal pain came and went for about two years. It was quite vague and hard to pinpoint.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. I also see that you had some vague chest pain and dyspnea, which prompted an echocardiogram in February 2015. The echocardiogram demonstrated a left ventricle ejection fraction of 44%. Consequently, a left heart catheterization in the following month showed no significant coronary disease, but a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: In July 2015, a Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed suspicious cirrhosis, possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A CT scan was determined to be necessary because of your rising alkaline phosphatase levels without other explainable etiologies, as well as your appetite suppression and the vague abdominal pains you were experiencing. At that time, your weight was 207 lbs (93.89 kg), and you were advised to diet and exercise. \nPatient: Yes, I remember that. I tried my best to follow the advice.\nDoctor: After 4 months of continuous symptoms, especially the abdominal pain, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with a liver biopsy in September 2015. The liver biopsy showed coalescing periportal nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation. The chronic and patchy inflammation is representative of granulomatous hepatitis, despite not having elevated transaminases. \nPatient: Oh, I see. So that's what was causing the pain and inflammation.\nDoctor: Yes, it appears so. Now, it's important that we continue to monitor your alkaline phosphatase levels and other symptoms.

Consequently, a left heart catheterization in the following month showed no significant coronary disease, but a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. \nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: In July 2015, a Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed suspicious cirrhosis, possibly due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A CT scan was determined to be necessary because of your rising alkaline phosphatase levels without other explainable etiologies, as well as your appetite suppression and the vague abdominal pains you were experiencing. At that time, your weight was 207 lbs (93.89 kg), and you were advised to diet and exercise. \nPatient: Yes, I remember that. I tried my best to follow the advice.\nDoctor: After 4 months of continuous symptoms, especially the abdominal pain, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed with a liver biopsy in September 2015. The liver biopsy showed coalescing periportal nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation. The chronic and patchy inflammation is representative of granulomatous hepatitis, despite not having elevated transaminases. \nPatient: Oh, I see. So that's what was causing the pain and inflammation.\nDoctor: Yes, it appears so. Now, it's important that we continue to monitor your alkaline phosphatase levels and other symptoms. Please make sure to keep up with your diet and exercise regimen, as this can help improve your overall health and potentially alleviate some of your symptoms. \nPatient: Okay, I will do my best. Thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any concerns or your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you. Take care!\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help."},{"role":"assistant","content":"S: The patient is a 60-year-old African American female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis, and chronic lower back pain. She reports a history of vague abdominal pain and denies any use of alcohol or tobacco. The abdominal pain was intermittent and lasted for about two years. She also experienced vague chest pain and dyspnea.\nO: Previous investigations revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase levels first noted in 2013. An abdominal ultrasound indicated hepatic steatosis, and viral serologies for hepatitis were negative. An echocardiogram in February 2015 showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 44%, and a subsequent left heart catheterization revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 50%. A CT scan in July 2015 suggested possible cirrhosis due to granulomatous changes and chronic inflammation. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy and liver biopsy in September 2015 confirmed coalescing periportal nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas with associated multinucleated giant cells and chronic inflammation, indicative of granulomatous hepatitis.\nA: The primary diagnosis is granulomatous hepatitis, as evidenced by liver biopsy findings. Differential diagnoses previously considered included hepatic steatosis and potential cirrhosis. The patient's history of vague abdominal and chest pain, along with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, supports the diagnosis. The prognosis depends on ongoing management and monitoring of liver function and related symptoms.\nP: Continue monitoring alkaline phosphatase levels and liver function. The patient should maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen to manage weight and overall health. Regular follow-ups should be scheduled to monitor her condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Education on the importance of diet and exercise in managing her condition should be reinforced. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear, she should seek immediate medical attention."}]}

{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, I wanted to discuss your recent diagnosis and treatment plan. You have been diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and have been treated with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the cancer has metastasized, and you now have end-stage lung cancer. \nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible news. What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We have been managing your cancer pain with oral opioid therapy. However, the metastasis of the cancer has caused obstructive jaundice and cholangitis, leading to septic shock. We performed an emergent endoscopic biliary stent placement to treat the obstructive jaundice.\nPatient: I see. And what about my blood pressure?\nDoctor: To maintain your blood pressure, we have been medicating you with a continuous infusion of noradrenaline at 0.2 \u03bcg\/kg\/min through a peripheral vein. However, due to the repeated placement of peripheral venous catheters, it has become difficult to identify adequate peripheral veins for placement and maintenance of indwelling catheters.\nPatient: Hmm, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: In addition to this, your congestive heart failure has continued, causing ascites and edema of the lower extremities. You have also been experiencing orthopnea and have been unable to sleep at night. We requested anesthesiologists to secure a reliable venous line for you.\nPatient: So, what happened with the anesthesiologists?\nDoctor: They checked your groin and thighs but excluded the femoral vein as a candidate for central venous access due to massive edema of the thighs. They attempted to allow you to assume the supine or reverse Trendelenburg position, but these positions caused worsening of your dyspnea.

You have been diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and have been treated with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the cancer has metastasized, and you now have end-stage lung cancer. \nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible news. What can be done about it?\nDoctor: We have been managing your cancer pain with oral opioid therapy. However, the metastasis of the cancer has caused obstructive jaundice and cholangitis, leading to septic shock. We performed an emergent endoscopic biliary stent placement to treat the obstructive jaundice.\nPatient: I see. And what about my blood pressure?\nDoctor: To maintain your blood pressure, we have been medicating you with a continuous infusion of noradrenaline at 0.2 \u03bcg\/kg\/min through a peripheral vein. However, due to the repeated placement of peripheral venous catheters, it has become difficult to identify adequate peripheral veins for placement and maintenance of indwelling catheters.\nPatient: Hmm, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: In addition to this, your congestive heart failure has continued, causing ascites and edema of the lower extremities. You have also been experiencing orthopnea and have been unable to sleep at night. We requested anesthesiologists to secure a reliable venous line for you.\nPatient: So, what happened with the anesthesiologists?\nDoctor: They checked your groin and thighs but excluded the femoral vein as a candidate for central venous access due to massive edema of the thighs. They attempted to allow you to assume the supine or reverse Trendelenburg position, but these positions caused worsening of your dyspnea. You could only tolerate the sitting position.\nPatient: I remember that.

Has anyone mentioned concerns about that before?\nPatient: No, not really.\nDoctor: Okay, from your history, I see that you've had a successful repair of cleft lip and palate. Now, let's discuss your extra-oral examination. We noticed facial asymmetry on the left side, flattening of the nasal bridge, increased intercanthal distance (35 centimeters) which is also known as orbital hypertelorism, and frontal bossing (54 centimeters). We also observed multiple skin lesions on your arms, and right foot and palmar\/plantar pits. Were you aware of these issues?\nPatient: Yeah, I noticed those, but didn't know what they meant.\nDoctor: In the intra-oral examination, we found multiple carious teeth, painless hard swelling in the left side of your mandible, and mild pain on percussion in all the left mandibular posterior teeth.

The left mandibular lesion extended up to the ramus of the mandible. Additionally, you have a horizontally impacted maxillary right second molar and congenitally missing second premolars and third molars. \nPatient: Oh, I didn't realize all that was going on in my mouth.\nDoctor: We decided to do a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) for a detailed radiological assessment of the mandibular lesions. Accidentally, the CBCT revealed another large lesion associated with the impacted right maxillary second molar, extending up to the right maxillary sinus. The lower left lesion was severely expanded in all directions (buccolingual, anteroposterior, and superoinferior), and we noticed perforations in the buccal and lingual borders of the mandible. \nPatient: That sounds serious. What does it mean?\nDoctor: It's definitely concerning, and we'll need to address these issues before moving forward with orthodontic treatment. Lastly, a skull X-ray revealed calcification of the falx cerebri on the posteroanterior view. We'll need to monitor this closely and may need to consult with additional specialists to determine the best course of action.\nPatient: Alright, I understand. What are the next steps?\nDoctor: We will develop a treatment plan to address the multiple carious teeth and the lesions in your mouth. In the meantime, it's important to maintain good oral hygiene and attend regular dental checkups.

Differential diagnoses previously considered included benign gastric stenosis and chronic gastritis, which were ruled out through biopsies and imaging.\nP: The management plan will involve multidisciplinary consultation, including oncology for chemotherapy options and palliative care to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Continued use of proton pump inhibitors will be recommended to manage gastric acidity and symptom relief. Patient education will focus on treatment expectations and symptom management, with psychological support offered to help cope with the diagnosis of metastatic cancer."}]}
{"dialogue":"Doctor: Hello, I understand that you were diagnosed with infectious cervical tuberculosis on C1 about a year ago, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: And you underwent posterior C1-2 screw-plate fixation surgery at a hospital in India. How did you feel after the surgery?\nPatient: Initially, my neck pain improved, but over the last nine months, my swallowing function has gradually worsened.\nDoctor: I see. You also experienced loss of reduction and progressive dysphagia, along with severe weight loss, right?\nPatient: Yes, exactly. I was referred to your hospital because of these issues.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing that information. I also see in your medical history that you have hypertension and mild diabetes mellitus, with an HbA1c of 6.2% NGSP. Have you been receiving antitubercular treatment since your diagnosis?\nPatient: Yes, I've been taking the prescribed medications from my local hospital.\nDoctor: Good to know. Now, let's discuss your current condition. Your height is 165 cm, and your weight is 52 kg, which gives you a BMI of 19. You've lost 25 kg over the past 7 months due to difficulty in swallowing. Are you currently using a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding?\nPatient: Yes, I am. It's been helping me get the nutrition I need.\nDoctor: That's important for your recovery. During your neurological examination, we found left dominant proximal arm muscle weakness with atrophy, dysesthesia in distal fingers, and hyperreflexia throughout with bilateral extensor plantar reflex. In your oral examination, we noticed left tongue atrophy and left tongue deviation, consistent with unilateral HNP. Your routine blood work showed a slightly elevated level of C reactive protein (CRP), but the other findings were normal. Does this sound accurate to you?\nPatient: Yes, that's what I've been told.\nDoctor: We also performed a chest X-ray, which showed no specific abnormality. However, the lateral cervical X-ray showed an O-C2 angle of 17-degree kyphosis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an erosive lesion at the dens and anterior arch of the atlas. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in that area?\nPatient: Yes, I have. It's been quite bothersome.\nDoctor: I can imagine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a space-occupying lesion in the retropharyngeal space, which presented with heterogeneous signals on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Interestingly, a review of your previous imaging studies showed that the lesion has been gradually decreasing in size, despite the progression of O-C kyphosis. \nPatient: Oh, that's good to hear.\nDoctor: So, your main problems right now are severe dysphagia and subsequent malnutrition, as well as neck pain. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, it's important to continue using the NG tube for feeding and taking your antitubercular medications.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help you.","soap":"S: The patient, previously diagnosed with infectious cervical tuberculosis on C1, reports progressive dysphagia and severe weight loss over the past nine months following posterior C1-2 screw-plate fixation surgery.

Do you have any other medical history we should be aware of?\nPatient: No, the rest of my medical history is free.\nDoctor: Alright, let's start with a clinical examination. *Examines patient* I notice a polypoid lesion protruding from your right nostril, asymmetry of your face, and projection of the ipsilateral canine fossa.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We'll need to perform a computed tomography of your paranasal sinuses to get a clearer picture of what's going on. *Reviews CT results* The CT shows an inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass that completely occupies your right nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The lesion has caused extensive bone remodeling of your right maxillary sinus with complete absence of its anterior wall, erosion of the posterior wall, and entry of the lesion in the pterygopalatine fossa.

We also had a preoperative maxillofacial consultation, which excluded pathology of odontogenic origin.\nPatient: What's the next step, then?\nDoctor: We'll have you undergo a biopsy under local anesthesia. *Performs biopsy* The findings show nonspecific inflammation. We'll need to perform open surgery under general anesthesia via lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy.\nPatient: Okay, let's do it.\n*After surgery*\nDoctor: The surgery went well. The maxillary sinus mucosa was completely replaced by inflammatory tissue, which we were able to mobilize and dissect free from surrounding tissues within the orbit and pterygopalatine fossa. There was no macroscopic invasion of any neighboring structures.
